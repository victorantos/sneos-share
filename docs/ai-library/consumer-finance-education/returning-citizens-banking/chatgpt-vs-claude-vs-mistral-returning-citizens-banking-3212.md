Non-residents may need to provide an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) or other relevant identifiers.\n\n4. **Date of Birth**: Banks generally need to verify the customer's age, which is often done by requesting the date of birth on the ID.\n\n5. **Additional Documentation**: Depending on the type of account or service (such as loans), banks may request further information, which can include:\n   - Employment verification (pay stubs, employment letters)\n   - Financial statements (if applicable for loans)\n   - Additional forms of identification\n\n6. **Video Verification**: In some cases, especially with online banking, some institutions may use video calls to verify identity.\n\n7. **Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance**: Banks typically follow KYC regulations which require them to collect and verify identity information to ensure they know who they are dealing with.\n\n8. **Enhanced Due Diligence**: For high-risk customers or transactions, banks may have stricter requirements and ask for more detailed information.\n\n### Considerations\n- It is essential to check with the specific bank or financial institution for their exact identification requirements.\n- Privacy practices should also be considered, as banks must protect personal information according to applicable laws.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, identification requirements are an essential part of banking, facilitating secure and compliant financial services. Always consult with your bank for their specific policies, as they can differ widely based on local laws and the bank's own policies.",
