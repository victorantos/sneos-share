Always check with your specific bank for their requirements, as they may have unique policies regarding accepted documents.",

    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down what constitutes proof of residency for banking purposes. Banks need to verify your address to comply with regulations like the Bank Secrecy Act and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules.  They need to be sure you are who you say you are and where you say you live.\n\n**Commonly Accepted Documents:**\n\nThe *best* documents are usually official and recent (within the last 3 months is generally preferred, though some banks might accept older documents). Here\u0027s a list of the most common and reliable options:\n\n*   **Utility Bill:**\n    *   **What it is:** A bill for a service like electricity, gas, water, internet, or cable TV.\n    *   **Important:**  It *must* be in your name (or, in some cases, a joint account with a spouse/partner).  A bill in a roommate\u0027s name won\u0027t work.  Often, a *physical* bill is required, but some banks may accept online statements you can print, but not a simple screenshot of a bill on your phone.\n    *   **Tips:** Use the most recent bill possible.\n\n*   **Bank Statement:**\n    *   **What it is:** A statement from another bank or financial institution.\n    *   **Important:** It has to show your name and current address.  If you\u0027re opening your *first* bank account, this won\u0027t be an option.\n\n*   **Credit Card Statement:**\n    *   **What it is:** A statement from a credit card company.\n    *   **Important:** Similar to a bank statement, it needs your name and address.\n\n*   **Driver\u0027s License or State-Issued ID Card:**\n    *   **What it is:** Government-issued identification.\n    *   **Important:** While widely accepted, some banks may *not* accept it *as the sole proof of residency* if the address on the ID doesn\u0027t match the address you\u0027re providing for the account. It\u0027s usually best if it does match. Some banks may require this in addition to another residency proof item.\n\n*   **Lease Agreement (Rental Agreement):**\n    *   **What it is:** A legally binding contract between you and your landlord.\n    *   **Important:** It must be a current, valid lease agreement.  It needs to show your name, the landlord\u0027s name (or property management company), the property address, and the lease dates.\n\n*   **Mortgage Statement:**\n    *   **What it is:** A statement from your mortgage lender.\n    *   **Important:** If you own your home, this is a good option.\n\n*   **Property Tax Bill:**\n    *   **What it is:** A bill for property taxes.\n    *   **Important:** Needs to show your name and the property address.\n\n*   **Official Government Correspondence:**\n    *   **What it is:** Mail from a government agency (federal, state, or local).\n    *   **Examples:**  Tax refund notice, Social Security statement, jury duty summons, or anything from the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) *other* than your driver\u0027s license itself.\n    *   **Important:** The correspondence must be recent and clearly show your name and address.\n\n**Important Considerations and Potential Issues:**\n\n*   **Matching Names:**  The name on the document *must* match the name you\u0027re using to open the bank account. If you\u0027ve recently changed your name (marriage, divorce, etc.), you\u0027ll need to provide documentation of the name change (marriage certificate, divorce decree, court order).\n*   **P.O. Boxes:**  A P.O. Box is *not* a valid proof of residency. Banks need your physical street address.\n*   **Online vs. Physical Documents:**  While some banks accept printed online statements, others require original, physical documents mailed to you. *Always check with the bank directly.*\n*   **Age of Documents:**  Most banks require documents to be recent, usually within the last 3 months.\n*   **Specific Bank Requirements:**  *Every bank has its own specific policies.*  It\u0027s absolutely crucial to check with the bank you\u0027re opening an account with to confirm exactly what documents they will accept.  Call them, visit their website, or ask in person.\n*   **If You Live With Someone Else:** This can be tricky.\n    *   **If you are on the lease/mortgage/utility bills:**  Then you can use those as proof.\n    *   **If you are *not* on those documents:**  You may need a notarized letter from the person whose name *is* on the documents, stating that you live at the address. The bank may also require a copy of that person\u0027s ID and proof of residency. This is more common with smaller, local banks.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet\u0027s say you\u0027re opening a new checking account at a national bank.  You\u0027ve recently moved.  You could use:\n\n1.  **Your current driver\u0027s license** *if* it shows your new address *AND* a recent (within 3 months) **utility bill** in your name for your new address.\n2.  *OR* Your current driver\u0027s license (even if it has your old address) *AND* a copy of your **signed lease agreement** for your new apartment.\n3. *OR* a printed copy of your bank statement from another bank which shows your current address along with your current driver\u0027s license.\n\n**In summary, the best approach is to:**\n\n1.  **Contact the bank directly** and ask them for a list of acceptable documents for proof of residency.\n2.  **Gather the required documents** that meet their criteria.\n3.  **Make sure the documents are recent, in your name, and show your current physical address.**\n\nBy doing these things, you\u0027ll minimize the risk of delays or issues when opening your bank account. Good luck!\n",
    "Mistral": "To open a bank account or apply for certain banking services, you may be required to provide proof of residency. The specific documents accepted can vary by bank and country, but generally, the following are commonly accepted forms of residency proof:\n\n1. **Utility Bills**: Recent utility bills (electricity, water, gas, internet) in your name, showing your current address.\n2. **Rental Agreement**: A lease or rental agreement that includes your name and current address.\n3. **Mortgage Statement**: A mortgage statement or deed of sale for your property.\n4. **Bank Statements**: Recent bank statements showing your current address.\n5. **Government-Issued Documents**: Documents such as a driver\u0027s license, voter registration card, or tax documents that include your current address.\n6. **Employment Letter**: A letter from your employer confirming your address.\n7. **Insurance Documents**: Insurance policies or statements that include your current address.\n8. **School Records**: For students, a letter from your school or university confirming your address.\n9. **Post Office Box**: In some cases, a post office box may be accepted if it is linked to a physical address.\n\n### Tips for Providing Residency Proof:\n- **Recent Documents**: Ensure that the documents are recent, typically within the last 3-6 months.\n- **Original Copies**: Banks often require original documents or certified copies.\n- **Consistency**: Make sure the address on your residency proof matches the address you provide on your application.\n- **Multiple Documents**: Sometimes, banks may require more than one form of residency proof.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **International Students/Expats**: If you are an international student or expat, you may need to provide additional documentation, such as a student visa or work permit.\n- **Temporary Addresses**: If you are using a temporary address, be prepared to explain your situation and provide additional documentation if needed.\n\nAlways check with the specific bank for their exact requirements, as they can vary."
