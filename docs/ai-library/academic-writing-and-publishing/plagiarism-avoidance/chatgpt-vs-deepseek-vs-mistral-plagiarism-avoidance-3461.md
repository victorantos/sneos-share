  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Avoiding plagiarism in academic writing is essential to maintain integrity and give credit to original authors. Two key strategies are proper citation and effective paraphrasing. Here\u2019s how to apply them:\n\n### 1. Proper Citation\n- **Identify the source:** Whenever you use ideas, quotes, data, or any content from another author, acknowledge the source.\n- **Use the correct citation style:** Follow the required style guide (APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard, etc.) for in-text citations and reference lists.\n- **Include all necessary details:** Author(s), title, publication year, publisher, page numbers (if applicable), and DOI or URL for online sources.\n- **Quote accurately:** Use quotation marks for direct quotes and provide a citation immediately after.\n\n### 2. Effective Paraphrasing\n- **Understand the original text:** Read the source carefully until you grasp the full meaning.\n- **Rewrite in your own words:** Express the idea using different vocabulary and sentence structure without changing the meaning.\n- **Avoid simply changing a few words:** Merely swapping synonyms or rearranging words is insufficient and may still count as plagiarism.\n- **Cite the source:** Even when paraphrased, the original author deserves credit.\n- **Combine paraphrasing with summarizing:** For longer passages, condense the main points in your own words.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Use plagiarism detection tools:** Check your work to ensure originality.\n- **Keep track of sources:** Organize research notes clearly linking ideas to their references.\n- **When in doubt, cite:** It is better to over-cite than under-cite.\n\n### Example\n\nOriginal text:\n\u003E \u201CAcademic integrity is a fundamental value that underpins the trustworthiness of scholarly work\u201D (Smith, 2020, p. 15).\n\nParaphrased example:\nSmith (2020) emphasizes that honesty in academic research is crucial for ensuring the reliability of scholarly outputs.\n\n---\n\nBy consistently applying proper citation and authentic paraphrasing, you can effectively avoid plagiarism in your academic writing.", "DeepSeek": "Of course. This is a crucial topic for any student, researcher, or academic. Avoiding plagiarism is not just about following rules; it\u0027s about engaging in the scholarly conversation with integrity.\n\nHere is a comprehensive guide to avoiding plagiarism through proper citation and paraphrasing.\n\n### Understanding Plagiarism\n\n**Plagiarism** is presenting someone else\u0027s work, ideas, or words as your own, without giving them proper credit. It is considered a serious academic offense, with consequences ranging from failing an assignment to expulsion.\n\nPlagiarism can be intentional (copying and pasting) or unintentional (poor paraphrasing or incorrect citation). **Ignorance is not an excuse.** The key is to always err on the side of over-citation.\n\n---\n\n### The Two Pillars of Avoiding Plagiarism\n\nThere are two primary, interconnected skills you must master:\n\n1. **Proper Paraphrasing**\n2. **Proper Citation**\n\nYou need **both**. Paraphrasing without citation is plagiarism. Citation without paraphrasing is just a direct quote.\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 1: Mastering the Art of Paraphrasing\n\nParaphrasing is not just swapping a few words with synonyms. It\u0027s **restating the original idea in your own words and sentence structure, while fully retaining the original meaning.**\n\n#### The Wrong Way to Paraphrase (Patchwriting)\n\n*Original Text:*\n\u003E \u0022The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, was a period of major technological and social change, marked by the shift from an agrarian economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing.\u0022\n\n**Bad Paraphrase (Plagiarism):**\n\u003E The Industrial Revolution, which started in Britain in the late 1700s, was a time of significant technological and social transformation, characterized by the change from a farming economy to one ruled by industry and machine production.\n\n*Why it\u0027s bad:* This is just \u0022word-swapping.\u0022 The sentence structure is identical, and many key phrases are copied directly.\n\n#### The Right Way to Paraphrase\n\n**A Step-by-Step Method:**\n\n1. **Read and Understand:** Read the original passage carefully until you fully grasp its meaning without looking at it.\n2. **Set the Original Aside:** Close the book or minimize the window. This forces you to use your own brain.\n3. **Write from Memory:** Explain the concept in your own words, as if you were teaching it to a classmate. Use your own vocabulary and sentence structure.\n4. **Compare and Check:** Look back at the original. Did you capture the core meaning accurately? Did you accidentally copy any unique phrases? If so, put them in quotation marks or rephrase them.\n5. **Cite the Source:** Even though it\u0027s in your own words, the idea came from someone else. You must provide a citation.\n\n**Good Paraphrase (with Citation):**\n\u003E The transition from a society based on agriculture to one centered on factory production and new machinery, known as the Industrial Revolution, originated in Great Britain during the 1780s and fundamentally reshaped technology and culture (Author, Year, p. X).\n\n*Why it\u0027s good:* The sentence structure is completely different, the vocabulary is new, and the core idea is accurately represented. **The citation is included.**\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 2: Proper Citation\n\nWhenever you use someone else\u0027s work, you must give them credit. This is done through a citation system.\n\n#### When to Cite:\n\n* **Direct Quotations:** Any time you use the exact words from a source. These must be enclosed in quotation marks and followed by a citation.\n* **Paraphrased Ideas:** When you restate an idea, theory, or data from a source.\n* **Summarized Information:** When you condense a large section of a source into a few sentences.\n* **Facts and Statistics:** Any specific data, statistics, or facts that are not common knowledge.\n\n#### What is \u0022Common Knowledge\u0022?\nCommon knowledge is information that is widely known and can be found in multiple general sources (e.g., \u0022Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius,\u0022 or \u0022Paris is the capital of France\u0022). You do not need to cite this. When in doubt, cite it.\n\n#### Choosing a Citation Style\nYour institution or professor will mandate a specific style guide. The most common are:\n\n* **APA (American Psychological Association):** Used in Social Sciences (Psychology, Education, etc.).\n * In-text: (Author, Year, p. X)\n * Reference list at the end.\n* **MLA (Modern Language Association):** Used in Humanities (Literature, Arts, etc.).\n * In-text: (Author X)\n * Works Cited list at the end.\n* **Chicago/Turabian:** Used in History, Business, and some fine arts. Offers two systems: Notes-Bibliography (using footnotes) and Author-Date.\n\n**You must be consistent and precise with your chosen style.**\n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together: A Practical Workflow\n\n1. **Research \u0026 Note-Taking:**\n * As you research, clearly distinguish in your notes between direct quotes (use quotation marks and note the page number), your own paraphrases, and your own thoughts/analysis.\n * **Record all source information immediately** (Author, Title, Year, Publisher, Page Numbers, URL, etc.). It\u0027s a nightmare to try and find it later.\n\n2. **Writing \u0026 Integrating Sources:**\n * **To use a direct quote:** Use it sparingly, only when the original wording is particularly powerful or unique. Introduce it, place it in \u0022quotation marks,\u0022 and add the citation.\n * **To use an idea:** Paraphrase it using the method above and add the citation.\n\n3. **The \u0022Sandwich\u0022 Method for Integrating Sources:**\n This is a best-practice structure for introducing any source material.\n * **Introduce:** Provide context. Who said it? \u0022According to historian Jane Doe...\u0022\n * **Insert:** Provide the quote, paraphrase, or summary.\n * **Explain/Analyze:** Explain *why* this source is relevant. What does it prove? How does it connect to your argument? This is your voice and analysis, which is the most important part.\n\n### Summary: A Quick Checklist\n\n* [ ] **All direct quotes are in quotation marks and cited.**\n* [ ] **All paraphrases are in my own words AND sentence structure AND cited.**\n* [ ] **All ideas, data, and facts from sources are cited, even if they are not direct quotes.**\n* [ ] **My own analysis and original thoughts are clearly distinguished from my sources.**\n* [ ] **My reference list (Works Cited / Bibliography) is complete and formatted correctly.**\n* [ ] **When in doubt, I have cited the source.**\n\nBy mastering paraphrasing and citation, you move from being a passive copier of information to an active, ethical, and respected participant in the world of ideas.", "Mistral": "Avoiding plagiarism in academic writing is crucial for maintaining academic integrity. Here are some strategies to help you properly cite sources and paraphrase effectively:\n\n### Proper Citation\n\n1. **Understand Citation Styles**:\n - Familiarize yourself with the citation style required by your institution or publication (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard).\n - Each style has specific guidelines for formatting in-text citations and reference lists.\n\n2. **In-Text Citations**:\n - For direct quotes, include the author\u0027s name, year of publication, and page number (if applicable).\n - For paraphrased information, include the author\u0027s name and year of publication.\n\n3. **Reference List**:\n - Ensure all sources cited in the text are included in the reference list.\n - Follow the specific format for each type of source (e.g., books, articles, websites).\n\n### Paraphrasing Effectively\n\n1. **Read and Understand**:\n - Read the original text thoroughly to understand its meaning.\n - Identify the main ideas and key points.\n\n2. **Rewrite in Your Own Words**:\n - Use your own words to express the ideas.\n - Change the sentence structure and vocabulary while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n3. **Avoid Copying Phrases**:\n - Do not copy more than a few words in a row from the original text.\n - Ensure that your paraphrase is significantly different from the original.\n\n4. **Cite the Source**:\n - Even when paraphrasing, always cite the original source to give credit to the author.\n - Include the author\u0027s name and year of publication in your in-text citation.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Original Text:\n\u0022The impact of climate change on global agriculture is significant, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affecting crop yields and food security.\u0022\n\n#### Paraphrased Text:\n\u0022Climate change has a substantial effect on worldwide agriculture, as increasing temperatures and altered rainfall patterns influence crop production and food availability.\u0022\n\n#### In-Text Citation (APA Style):\n\u0022Climate change has a substantial effect on worldwide agriculture, as increasing temperatures and altered rainfall patterns influence crop production and food availability (Smith, 2022).\u0022\n\n#### Reference List Entry (APA Style):\nSmith, J.
