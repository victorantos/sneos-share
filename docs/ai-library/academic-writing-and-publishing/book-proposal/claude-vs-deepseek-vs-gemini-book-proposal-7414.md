Here is a comprehensive and persuasive academic book proposal template, designed specifically for pitching a monograph to a university press.\n\nThis template includes explanations, placeholders, and strategic advice to guide you through the process. A strong proposal is your most important tool for securing a contract.\n\n---\n\n### **Academic Monograph Proposal: [Your Book Title]**\n\n**Submitted by:**\n[Your Name], [Your Title]\n[Your Department]\n[Your University]\n[Your Email]\n[Your Phone Number]\n[ORCID iD/Personal Website (Optional)]\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: The Core Pitch (The \u0022Elevator Pitch\u0022 for Editors)**\n\nThis section should be concise and compelling, allowing an editor to understand the project\u0027s value immediately.\n\n* **Working Title:** [A Clear and Engaging Title: The Subtitle Explains the Scope]\n * *Example: **Plato\u0027s Ghost: The Spectral Turn in Contemporary Philosophy***\n* **Author:** [Your Name and Affiliation]\n* **Project Summary (approx. 150-200 words):**\n \u003E [This is your hook. Start with the central problem or question your book addresses. Briefly state your argument, its intervention in the field, the primary sources/methodology used, and why it matters now. Avoid jargon; make it accessible to a non-specialist acquisitions editor.]\n \u003E\n \u003E *Example: \u0022**Plato\u0027s Ghost** argues that the late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a \u0027spectral turn\u0027 in Continental philosophy, a preoccupation with concepts of haunting, the ghostly, and the immaterial. Moving beyond the well-trodden analysis of Derrida\u0027s *Specters of Marx*, this book demonstrates how this spectral logic is central to the work of thinkers like Jean-Luc Nancy, Catherine Malabou, and Quentin Meillassoux. By tracing this theme across metaphysics, ethics, and political philosophy, the book offers a new framework for understanding contemporary thought\u0027s struggle with materiality and presence. It will be essential reading for scholars of philosophy, critical theory, and literary studies, providing a unified theory for a seemingly disparate trend.\u0022*\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: The Detailed Overview**\n\nThis section provides the substantive detail editors and reviewers need.\n\n**1. Overview and Central Argument:**\n\u003E [Expand on your summary. Elaborate on your main thesis. What is the specific, original claim you are making?

Methodology and Sources:**\n\u003E [Explain your approach. Are you doing archival work, theoretical analysis, close reading, digital humanities, ethnographic study? List the types of primary sources you use (e.g., state archives, literary texts, philosophical treatises, oral histories, film).]\n\n**4. Chapter Outline:**\n\u003E [Provide a descriptive paragraph for each chapter, not just a title. Show how the argument develops sequentially. This proves your project is well-structured and complete.]\n\u003E\n\u003E **Introduction: [Title of Introduction]** - [e.g., \u0022The introduction establishes the concept of the \u0027spectral turn,\u0027 defines key terms, and surveys the relevant literature...\u0022]\n\u003E **Chapter 1: [Title]** - [e.g., \u0022This chapter lays the historical groundwork by examining the pre-history of spectrality in early modern philosophy...\u0022]\n\u003E **Chapter 2: [Title]** - [e.g., \u0022Building on Chapter 1, this chapter analyzes the pivotal work of X, arguing that...\u0022]\n\u003E **...**\n\u003E **Conclusion: [Title of Conclusion]** - [e.g., \u0022The conclusion synthesizes the findings from each chapter and explores the implications for future philosophical inquiry in a digital age.\u0022]\n\n**5. Comparative Literature / Market Analysis:**\n\u003E [Demonstrate you know the publishing landscape. Identify 3-5 recently published competing books from major university presses.]\n\u003E * **[Book 1]** by Author (Press, Year): \u0022This excellent book focuses on [its specific niche]. My project differs by [your specific difference], offering a broader/revised/comparative perspective.\u0022\n\u003E * **[Book 2]** by Author (Press, Year): \u0022While this work shares my interest in [a topic], it is limited to [a region/time period/method]. My book expands the scope to include...\u0022\n\u003E * *This shows there is a market for your topic, but that your book offers something new and necessary.*\n\n**6. Target Audience:**\n\u003E [Be realistic and specific. \u0022Everyone\u0022 is not an audience.]\n\u003E * **Primary:** Scholars and graduate students in [Your Discipline], [Adjacent Discipline].\n\u003E * **Secondary:** Upper-level undergraduate courses in courses on [e.g., \u002220th Century European Philosophy,\u0022 \u0022Critical Theory,\u0022 \u0022History of Metaphysics\u0022].\n\u003E * **Potential Cross-over Appeal:** Scholars in [e.g., \u0022Literature and Philosophy,\u0022 \u0022Media Studies,\u0022 \u0022Sociology of Knowledge\u0022].\n\n**7.

Permission for republication will be secured.\u0022]\n\n---\n\n### **Part 3: The Practicalities**\n\n**1. About the Author:**\n\u003E [A short, professional bio (approx. 100 words). Highlight your PhD, current position, relevant prior publications, awards, or fellowships. Establish your credibility as the person to write this book.]\n\n**2. Sample Material:**\n\u003E [Typically, you would include 1-2 sample chapters (often the introduction and one core chapter) and your full CV. This allows reviewers to assess the quality of your writing and research.]\n\u003E * *Attached: Introduction, Chapter 3, and Curriculum Vitae.*\n\n---\n\n### **Part 4: Optional but Recommended**\n\n**1. Endorsements:**\n\u003E [If you have well-known scholars in your field who have agreed to read the proposal or manuscript, list them here.

Appendices:**\n\u003E * **Your full CV**\n\u003E * **Sample chapters**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Advice for Submission:**\n\n1. **Research the Press:** Don\u0027t send a generic proposal. Look at the press\u0027s catalog. Do they publish in your field? Have they published the competing titles you listed? Tailor your proposal to fit their list. Mention a specific series editor or series if appropriate.\n2. **Write for an Intelligent Generalist:** The first reader is often an acquisitions editor who is smart but not a specialist in your niche. Avoid excessive jargon; explain why your book is important in broad, intellectual terms.\n3. **Be Confident in Your Intervention:** Clearly and boldly state what your book does that no other book does. This is not the time for modesty.\n4. **Proofread Meticulously:** A sloppy proposal suggests a sloppy manuscript.\n5. **Follow Submission Guidelines:** Check the press\u0027s website for specific proposal requirements and follow them exactly.\n\nGood luck!
