  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "While I can\u0027t directly search databases for you, I can guide you on how to efficiently search for economic evaluations of telemedicine interventions in relevant databases, such as NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED).\n\n### Steps for Searching NHS EED:\n\n1. **Access NHS EED**:\n   - Go to the NHS EED website, which is hosted by the University of York (if available).\n   - If you have institutional access, log in through your library or institution.\n\n2. **Define Your Search Terms**:\n   - Identify key terms related to telemedicine, such as \u0022telemedicine\u0022, \u0022telehealth\u0022, \u0022remote consultation\u0022, \u0022e-health\u0022.\n   - Combine these with terms related to cost-effectiveness, such as \u0022cost-effectiveness\u0022, \u0022economic evaluation\u0022, \u0022cost-utility\u0022, \u0022cost-benefit\u0022.\n\n3. **Use Boolean Operators**:\n   - Use \u0060AND\u0060, \u0060OR\u0060, and \u0060NOT\u0060 to refine your search. For example:\n     - \u0060\u0022telemedicine\u0022 OR \u0022telehealth\u0022\u0060\n     - AND \u0060\u0022cost-effectiveness\u0022 OR \u0022economic evaluation\u0022\u0060\n\n4. **Apply Filters**:\n   - Use filters to narrow your results based on publication date, type of study, or population if available.\n\n5. **Review Search Results**:\n   - Look through the search results for relevant abstracts and titles.\n   - Note down articles that look promising based on the relevance to your review.\n\n6. **Access Full Text**:\n   - If the full text is not available through NHS EED, check if your institution has access through other databases or interlibrary loans.\n\n7. **Data Extraction**:\n   - Once you have the relevant articles, extract data on the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine interventions, including study design, population, results, and any economic modeling used.\n\n### Additional Resources for Economic Evaluations:\n\nBeyond NHS EED, you might consider searching in additional databases, such as:\n\n- **Cochrane Library**: For systematic reviews and economic evaluations.\n- **PubMed**: Use the search terms relevant to both healthcare intervention and economics.\n- **EMBASE**: Similar to PubMed but with a wider European literature scope.\n- **Health Economic Specialty Journals**: Like *Value in Health* and *Health Economics*.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry**: A database of economic evaluations.\n\n### Tracking Relevant Literature:\n\n- **Set up alerts** in your databases of interest to stay updated on newly published studies on telemedicine cost-effectiveness.\n- **Networking**: Connect with professionals in your field through academic networking sites like ResearchGate or LinkedIn.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be well-equipped to conduct your systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies related to telemedicine interventions. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific aspects of your review, feel free to ask!", "Gemini": "This is an excellent and important area for a systematic review! Telemedicine interventions are diverse, and understanding their cost-effectiveness is crucial for resource allocation.\n\nLet\u0027s break down how to systematically approach this, covering not just the search but also other critical aspects of your review.\n\n---\n\n## Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness Studies of Telemedicine Interventions\n\n### Part 1: Searching Economic and Medical Databases\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive search, you\u0027ll need to go beyond just economic databases, as many cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are published in general medical or specialty journals and indexed in broader biomedical databases.\n\n**A. Key Databases to Search:**\n\n1.  **Dedicated Health Economic Databases:**\n    *   **NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED):** (As you mentioned) Excellent for directly identifying full economic evaluations. Maintained by CRD, University of York.\n    *   **Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (part of The Cochrane Library):** Also from CRD, contains details of HTA reports, which often include economic evaluations.\n    *   **EconLit:** While broader economics, it can capture health economics papers not always indexed elsewhere.\n\n2.  **Major Biomedical Databases:**\n    *   **PubMed/MEDLINE:** Essential for biomedical literature. Use MeSH terms for precise searching.\n    *   **Embase:** Strong for pharmacology, medical devices, and clinical medicine. Emtree terms are crucial here.\n    *   **Web of Science (Core Collection):** Excellent for multidisciplinary coverage, citation tracking, and identifying highly cited papers. Includes Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, etc.\n    *   **Scopus:** Similar to Web of Science, broad multidisciplinary coverage, good for citation analysis.\n\n3.  **Specialized \u0026 Grey Literature Sources:**\n    *   **Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL):** While focused on trials, many trials include economic endpoints or sub-studies.\n    *   **PsycINFO:** If your telemedicine scope includes mental health interventions.\n    *   **Google Scholar:** Useful for identifying grey literature, conference proceedings, or articles missed by traditional databases. Be prepared for a higher volume of irrelevant results.\n    *   **Specific HTA Agency Websites:** (e.g., NICE, CADTH, AHRQ, IQWiG, PBAC) Check their published reports and guidelines, as these often contain or refer to economic evaluations.\n    *   **Professional Society Websites/Journals:** (e.g., ISPOR, AHSR, HEOR journals).\n\n**B. Developing a Comprehensive Search Strategy:**\n\nYou\u0027ll need to combine terms related to **telemedicine interventions** with terms related to **economic evaluation**.\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n1.  **Intervention Terms (Telemedicine/Telehealth):**\n    *   \u0060telemedicine OR telehealth OR eHealth OR mHealth OR virtual care OR remote monitoring OR teleconsultation OR telepresence OR teleradiology OR telepathology OR teleICU OR telenursing OR tele-rehabilitation OR \u0022digital health\u0022\u0060\n    *   Use truncation (\u0060tele*\u0060) where appropriate to capture variations (telemedicine, telemedecine, etc.).\n    *   Consider specific types if your review is narrower (e.g., \u0060(telemedicine OR telehealth) AND (diabetes OR \u0022chronic disease management\u0022)\u0060).\n\n2.  **Economic Evaluation Terms:**\n    *   \u0060cost-effectiveness OR \u0022cost effectiveness\u0022 OR cost-utility OR \u0022cost utility\u0022 OR cost-benefit OR \u0022cost benefit\u0022 OR \u0022economic evaluation\u0022 OR \u0022economic analysis\u0022 OR \u0022health economic\u0022 OR \u0022economic modelling\u0022 OR \u0022value for money\u0022 OR \u0022cost minimisation\u0022 OR \u0022cost minimization\u0022 OR \u0022cost-of-illness\u0022 OR cost*\u0060 (using \u0060cost*\u0060 to catch cost-saving, cost-reducing, etc., but be mindful of broadness).\n    *   Specific MeSH/Emtree terms: \u0060(\u0022Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\u0022[MeSH])\u0060 OR \u0060(\u0022Economic Evaluation\u0022[MeSH])\u0060 OR \u0060(\u0022Health Care Costs\u0022[MeSH])\u0060.\n\n**C. Example Search String (Illustrative for PubMed/MEDLINE):**\n\nThis is a template; you\u0027ll need to adapt it for each database, leveraging their specific syntax (e.g., MeSH terms in PubMed, Emtree in Embase, different field codes).\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n((telemedicine[MeSH] OR telehealth[tiab] OR eHealth[tiab] OR mHealth[tiab] OR \u0022virtual care\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022remote monitoring\u0022[tiab] OR teleconsultation[tiab] OR telepresence[tiab] OR teleradiology[tiab] OR telepathology[tiab] OR teleICU[tiab] OR telenursing[tiab] OR \u0022tele-rehabilitation\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022digital health\u0022[tiab])\nAND\n(\u0022Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\u0022[MeSH] OR \u0022Economic Evaluation\u0022[MeSH] OR \u0022Health Care Costs\u0022[MeSH] OR cost-effectiveness[tiab] OR \u0022cost effectiveness\u0022[tiab] OR cost-utility[tiab] OR \u0022cost utility\u0022[tiab] OR cost-benefit[tiab] OR \u0022cost benefit\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022economic evaluation\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022economic analysis\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022health economic\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022value for money\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022cost minimisation\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022cost minimization\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022cost-of-illness\u0022[tiab] OR cost*[tiab]))\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**D. Search Strategy Best Practices:**\n\n*   **Pilot Searches:** Run initial searches to identify relevant terms, MeSH/Emtree headings, and scope.\n*   **Documentation:** Keep a detailed record of all databases searched, search strings used, dates of search, and number of results. This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility (PRISMA guidelines).\n*   **Limits/Filters:**\n    *   **Language:** English (or other relevant languages).\n    *   **Publication Dates:** Define your timeframe (e.g., \u0022published after 2000\u0022).\n    *   **Study Type:** Some databases allow filtering for \u0022economic evaluation\u0022 or specific study designs, but use with caution as it can sometimes be too restrictive.\n    *   **Human Studies:** Exclude animal studies.\n*   **Duplicate Management:** Use reference management software (EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley) to import all results and remove duplicates.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Beyond the Search \u2013 The Full Systematic Review Process\n\nOnce you\u0027ve completed your comprehensive search, the systematic review really begins.\n\n**1. Eligibility Criteria:**\n\nClearly define what makes a study suitable for inclusion. This should be established *before* screening.\n\n*   **Study Design:** Only full economic evaluations (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)). Exclude budget impact analyses, simple cost analyses, or burden of illness studies unless they include comparative effectiveness.\n*   **Intervention:** Telemedicine/telehealth intervention, clearly defined.\n*   **Comparator:** Should compare telemedicine to usual care, another telemedicine modality, or no intervention.\n*   **Outcomes:** Must report economic outcomes (e.g., costs, QALYs, LYs, ICERs).\n*   **Population:** Specify if there\u0027s a target population (e.g., patients with chronic conditions, elderly, specific disease groups).\n*   **Setting:** (e.g., primary care, hospital, home-based).\n*   **Language \u0026 Publication Date:** Consistent with your search.\n\n**2. Screening and Selection:**\n\n*   **Two-Stage Process:**\n    1.  **Title and Abstract Screening:** Two independent reviewers will screen all titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria. Discrepancies are resolved by discussion or a third reviewer.\n    2.  **Full-Text Review:** Retrieve full texts of all potentially relevant articles. Two independent reviewers will read these against the eligibility criteria. Record reasons for exclusion for each full-text article (crucial for your PRISMA flow diagram).\n*   **PRISMA Flow Diagram:** Document the number of records identified, screened, excluded (with reasons), and included at each stage.\n\n**3. Data Extraction:**\n\nDevelop a standardized data extraction form *before* starting. This should be piloted on a few articles and revised as needed. Two independent reviewers should extract data to ensure accuracy.\n\nKey data points to extract:\n\n*   **Study Characteristics:** Authors, year, country, funding, study setting, type of telemedicine intervention.\n*   **Intervention \u0026 Comparator Details:** Specifics of the telemedicine intervention (technology, duration, frequency, target population, providers) and the comparator.\n*   **Methodology:**\n    *   Type of economic evaluation (CEA, CUA, CBA, CMA).\n    *   Perspective (e.g., societal, healthcare payer, patient).\n    *   Time horizon.\n    *   Discount rate (for costs and effects).\n    *   Source of effectiveness data (e.g., RCT, observational study, modeling).\n    *   Main outcome measure (e.g., QALYs, DALYs, life-years gained).\n    *   Cost components included (e.g., intervention costs, healthcare resource use, patient costs).\n    *   Handling of uncertainty (e.g., sensitivity analyses, probabilistic sensitivity analysis).\n*   **Results:**\n    *   Total costs (intervention \u0026 comparator).\n    *   Total effects (intervention \u0026 comparator).\n    *   Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR), or Net Monetary Benefit (NMB).\n    *   Conclusion regarding cost-effectiveness.\n    *   Results of sensitivity analyses.\n\n**4. Quality Appraisal (Risk of Bias/Methodological Quality):**\n\nThis is critical for economic evaluations. You need to assess the methodological rigor and reporting quality of the included studies.\n\n*   **Recommended Tools:**\n    *   **CHEERS Checklist (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards):** While primarily for reporting, it\u0027s a good guide for what *should* be in a high-quality economic evaluation and can serve as a proxy for methodological quality if items are clearly reported.\n    *   **Drummond Checklist (or variations):** A widely used checklist specifically designed for assessing the methodological quality of economic evaluations.\n    *   **Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument:** Another option for assessing quality.\n    *   **NICE/ISPOR Guidelines:** Familiarize yourself with these guidelines, as they represent best practices in conducting economic evaluations.\n\n*   **Key Domains to Assess:**\n    *   **Perspective:** Is it appropriate and clearly stated?\n    *   **Time Horizon:** Is it long enough to capture all relevant costs and effects?\n    *   **Discounting:** Are costs and effects discounted appropriately for studies longer than one year?\n    *   **Costs:** Are all relevant cost components identified, measured, and valued appropriately?\n    *   **Outcomes:** Are health outcomes measured appropriately (e.g., QALYs derived from valid utility measures)?\n    *   **Incremental Analysis:** Is a proper incremental analysis performed?\n    *   **Uncertainty:** Are sensitivity analyses performed and adequately reported to address uncertainty in key parameters?\n    *   **Transparency:** Are methods and data sources clearly reported?\n\n**5. Data Synthesis and Analysis:**\n\nEconomic evaluations are often heterogeneous (different methods, perspectives, populations, interventions), making quantitative meta-analysis of ICERs challenging.\n\n*   **Descriptive Synthesis:**\n    *   Summarize the characteristics of included studies (tables of study design, intervention, comparator, population, country, year).\n    *   Describe the type of telemedicine interventions studied and the health conditions.\n    *   Summarize the reported ICERs, cost-effectiveness conclusions, and main drivers of cost-effectiveness across studies.\n*   **Qualitative Synthesis:**\n    *   Identify common themes and trends regarding cost-effectiveness.\n    *   Explore reasons for heterogeneity (e.g., differences in perspective, time horizon, specific telemedicine modality, patient population, healthcare system).\n    *   Discuss the robustness of findings, particularly with respect to sensitivity analyses.\n    *   Compare findings to established cost-effectiveness thresholds (e.g., country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds).\n*   **Visualizations:**\n    *   Forest plots for cost differences or effect differences (if comparable).\n    *   Cost-effectiveness planes (if sufficient data allows for plotting).\n    *   Summary tables of ICERs and conclusions, potentially stratified by type of telemedicine or disease.\n\n**6. Reporting:**\n\n*   Follow the **PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement** for reporting your review.\n*   Additionally, ensure your reporting aligns with best practices for systematic reviews of economic evaluations, often drawing on elements from the CHEERS checklist for *describing* the included studies.\n*   Clearly articulate your methods, results, limitations, and conclusions. Discuss the implications for policy and future research.\n\n---\n\nThis systematic approach will ensure your review is rigorous, comprehensive, and provides valuable insights into the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine interventions. Good luck!", "Mistral": "Certainly! Conducting a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies of telemedicine interventions involves several steps, including searching relevant databases. The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) was a valuable resource for economic evaluations, but it was discontinued in 2015.
