  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Updating a systematic review involves a few key steps. To effectively obtain the original search strategies and eligibility criteria from the older review, consider the following approach:\n\n### 1. Locate the Original Systematic Review\n- **Journal Website**: Start by finding the systematic review in a journal database (PubMed, JSTOR, etc.) or the journal\u0027s official website. Use relevant keywords, the title, or the authors\u2019 names to search.\n- **Library Access**: If you have access to an academic library, they might have subscriptions to journals. Use library resources or consult a librarian.\n\n### 2. Review the Full Text\n- **Methods Section**: Systematic reviews will typically have a dedicated \u0022Methods\u0022 section where the authors outline the search strategies and eligibility criteria.\n- **Supplementary Materials**: Sometimes, detailed methods, including search strategies, are provided in supplementary materials. Check if there are any additional documents linked to the original article.\n\n### 3. Reference the Original Review\n- If you have difficulty accessing the full text, see if there\u0027s an accompanying reference list where you might find details about the databases searched, key terms, and eligibility criteria.\n\n### 4. Contact the Authors\n- **Reach Out**: If the original search strategies are not detailed enough in the publication, you might consider contacting the authors directly (if they are reachable). They can provide insights or details regarding their methods.\n\n### 5. Look for Protocols\n- **Check for Registered Protocols**: Some systematic reviews are registered in platforms like PROSPERO. If the original review authors registered their protocol, it may contain detailed information about their search strategies and eligibility criteria.\n\n### 6. Utilize Existing Databases\n- Check out databases like Cochrane, trials registries, or other sources where systematic reviews are documented. They may provide additional context or links to the original review.\n\nOnce you have access to the search strategies and eligibility criteria, you can then proceed with your update by searching for new literature following the same methodologies, ensuring comparability with the original systematic review.", "Gemini": "Updating a systematic review is a valuable contribution! The first and most critical step is indeed to thoroughly understand the original review\u0027s methodology. Here\u0027s a systematic approach to obtain the original search strategies and eligibility criteria:\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Exhaustive Search of the Published Article and Supplementary Materials\n\nThis is your primary and most accessible source.\n\n1.  **Read the Main Article Thoroughly:**\n    *   **Methods Section:** This is where the authors *must* describe their approach. Look for subsections on:\n        *   **Search Strategy:**\n            *   List of databases searched (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL).\n            *   Date ranges of the search.\n            *   Key search terms or keywords used (often a truncated list).\n            *   Mention of Boolean operators (AND/OR), truncation (*), wildcard (?), field codes (e.g., [tiab] for title/abstract).\n            *   Information on grey literature searches (e.g., clinical trial registries, conference proceedings, theses, hand-searching reference lists).\n            *   *Crucially, look for statements like:* \u0022The full search strategy for PubMed is provided in Appendix 1,\u0022 or \u0022See Supplementary Material for complete search strings.\u0022\n        *   **Eligibility Criteria:**\n            *   This is typically described using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) or PEO (Population, Exposure, Outcome) framework, or sometimes PICOS (PICO \u002B Study Design).\n            *   **Participants/Population:** Who was studied? (e.g., adults with type 2 diabetes, children aged 6-12).\n            *   **Intervention/Exposure:** What was the focus? (e.g., a specific drug, a behavioral therapy, environmental pollutant).\n            *   **Comparator (if applicable):** What was the intervention compared against? (e.g., placebo, standard care, no intervention).\n            *   **Outcomes:** What were the primary and secondary outcomes measured? (e.g., blood pressure, quality of life, adverse events).\n            *   **Study Design:** What types of studies were included? (e.g., randomized controlled trials, observational studies, cohort studies).\n            *   **Language:** Were there language restrictions? (e.g., English only).\n            *   **Publication Date:** Were there date restrictions? (e.g., published after 2000).\n            *   **Publication Status:** Were only published studies included, or grey literature too? (e.g., \u0022peer-reviewed articles only,\u0022 or \u0022including conference abstracts\u0022).\n\n2.  **Scrutinize Appendices and Supplementary Materials:**\n    *   **Check the end of the main article:** Many journals include appendices here.\n    *   **Look for links on the journal\u0027s website:** Most journals host supplementary files online, often linked directly from the article\u0027s landing page. These might be PDF documents, Word files, or Excel sheets.\n    *   **What to look for:**\n        *   **Full Search Strategies:** This is the *most likely* place to find the complete, line-by-line search strings for *each database* used. This is gold! It will show you exactly how they combined terms, applied field codes, and used limits.\n        *   **Detailed Eligibility Tables:** Sometimes a table outlining inclusion and exclusion criteria with specific examples is provided.\n        *   **PRISMA Flow Diagram:** While not the criteria itself, this diagram can give you an overview of how many studies were identified and screened, and where exclusions happened, which implicitly reflects the criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Check for Pre-registration or Protocol Publication\n\nMany systematic reviews are pre-registered or have a published protocol, which often contains more detail than the final published paper.\n\n1.  **PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews):**\n    *   **Check the published article:** Look for a PROSPERO registration number (e.g., \u0022PROSPERO CRD42018xxxxxx\u0022) usually in the methods section or acknowledgements.\n    *   **Search PROSPERO directly:** Go to [www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/](http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) and search by the review\u0027s title, keywords, or the lead author\u0027s name.\n    *   **What you might find:** PROSPERO registrations require detailed information on eligibility criteria, planned search strategies for *each database*, data extraction plans, and risk of bias assessment methods. This can be an incredibly rich source.\n\n2.  **Other Registries/Protocol Journals:**\n    *   **OSF Registries:** ([osf.io/registries](http://osf.io/registries)) Some reviews might be registered here.\n    *   **Cochrane Library / Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI):** If the original review was conducted by a Cochrane or JBI group, their protocols are typically published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews or the JBI Evidence Synthesis.\n    *   **Specific Protocol Journals:** Some journals specifically publish systematic review protocols (e.g., *Systematic Reviews* journal by BMC).\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Contact the Original Authors\n\nIf after Phases 1 and 2 you still cannot find the complete information, contacting the original authors is a professional and often fruitful approach.\n\n1.  **Identify the Corresponding Author:** Their email address is usually provided in the published article.\n2.  **Draft a Polite and Specific Email:**\n    *   **Introduce yourself:** Briefly state your affiliation and purpose.\n    *   **State your intention:** Clearly mention you are planning to update their systematic review. Acknowledge their work.\n    *   **Be specific about what you need:**\n        *   \u0022We are having difficulty locating the full search strategy as run in [specific database, e.g., Embase or Web of Science].\u0022\n        *   \u0022Could you please share the complete search strategy files (e.g., text files or screenshots) for each database used in your review?\u0022\n        *   \u0022Are there any additional details regarding your eligibility criteria that were not fully captured in the published article or PROSPERO registration?\u0022\n    *   **Offer collaboration (optional but can be helpful):** You might suggest acknowledging their contribution in your update or even offering them a chance to be involved if appropriate and they are interested.\n    *   **Thank them in advance:**\n    *   **Example Email Snippet:**\n        \u003E Dear Dr. [Author\u0027s Last Name],\n        \u003E\n        \u003E My name is [Your Name] from [Your Institution]. I am a researcher in [Your Field] and I am planning to update your excellent systematic review, \u0022[Review Title],\u0022 published in [Journal Name] (DOI: [DOI]).\n        \u003E\n        \u003E To ensure consistency and rigor in our update, we are trying to obtain the complete, line-by-line search strategies as run in each of the databases you utilized (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Web of Science). While we found some details in the article\u0027s methods section and supplementary materials, we are keen to replicate the exact searches for all platforms.\n        \u003E\n        \u003E Would you be able to share these full search strategies with us, or point us to where we might find them? Any guidance on specific eligibility criteria nuances not fully captured in the main text would also be greatly appreciated.\n        \u003E\n        \u003E Thank you very much for your time and assistance.\n        \u003E\n        \u003E Sincerely,\n        \u003E [Your Name]\n        \u003E [Your Affiliation]\n        \u003E [Your Contact Info]\n\n3.  **Be Patient:** Authors are busy. Give them a week or two to respond. If you don\u0027t hear back, a single polite follow-up email is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Consult a Research Librarian (Highly Recommended!)\n\nResearch librarians, especially those specializing in systematic reviews or your specific field, are experts in database searching and locating information.\n\n*   **How they can help:**\n    *   They can often help you navigate complex journal websites or institutional repositories.\n    *   They might have access to specialized databases or resources that you don\u0027t.\n    *   They can review the published methods and give you advice on where the full strategies might be hidden, or how to *reconstruct* them if they are truly unavailable.\n    *   They can offer invaluable advice for developing your *updated* search strategy.\n\n---\n\n## What if You Still Can\u0027t Get the Full Strategy? (Worst Case Scenario)\n\nIf, after all these steps, you cannot obtain the complete search strategies for all databases, you will need to:\n\n1.  **Clearly document your attempts:** State in your updated review that you made every effort to obtain the original strategies and outline the steps you took.\n2.  **Reconstruct the strategy:** Based on the keywords and partial strategies provided in the main paper, and potentially the eligibility criteria, you will need to infer and reconstruct a search strategy as closely as possible. This is more challenging but sometimes necessary. You\u0027ll need to justify your reconstruction.\n3.  **Acknowledge limitations:** Be transparent about the fact that you had to reconstruct part of the original methodology.\n\nBy following this systematic approach, you significantly increase your chances of obtaining the original search strategies and eligibility criteria, setting a strong foundation for your updated systematic review. Good luck!", "Mistral": "Updating a systematic review is a valuable endeavor, as it ensures that the most current evidence is considered. Here are the steps you can follow to obtain the original search strategies and eligibility criteria:\n\n### 1. Locate the Original Systematic Review\n- **Identify the Review**: Ensure you have the full text of the original systematic review. This is usually available through academic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, or Google Scholar.\n- **Check the Methods Section**: The methods section of the review typically includes detailed information about the search strategies and eligibility criteria.\n\n### 2. Extract Search Strategies\n- **Search Terms and Databases**: Look for the specific search terms, keywords, and databases used in the original review. This information is often presented in a table or a detailed paragraph.\n- **Boolean Operators**: Note the use of Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and any filters applied (e.g., date range, language).\n- **Supplementary Materials**: Sometimes, the search strategies are provided in supplementary materials or appendices. Check these sections if the main text does not provide sufficient detail.\n\n### 3. Extract Eligibility Criteria\n- **Inclusion Criteria**: Identify the criteria used to include studies in the review. This might include study design, population characteristics, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes (PICO framework).\n- **Exclusion Criteria**: Note any specific exclusion criteria, such as language restrictions, publication types, or study quality thresholds.\n- **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame covered by the original review. This will help you decide the starting point for your updated search.\n\n### 4. Contact the Authors\n- **Email Correspondence**: If the methods section does not provide enough detail, consider contacting the authors of the original review. They may be able to provide additional information or even share their original search strategies and eligibility criteria.\n- **Professional Networks**: Use professional networks like ResearchGate or LinkedIn to reach out to the authors if their contact information is not readily available.\n\n### 5. Document Everything\n- **Create a Detailed Record**: Document all the information you gather, including the search strategies, databases, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and any additional filters or limitations.\n- **Organize Information**: Use a structured format to organize this information, such as a table or a flowchart, to ensure clarity and ease of reference.\n\n### Example Template for Documentation\n\n#### Search Strategies\n| Database       | Search Terms                                  | Boolean Operators | Filters                  |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| PubMed         | (\u0022intervention\u0022 OR \u0022treatment\u0022) AND \u0022outcome\u0022 | AND, OR            | Date: 2000-2018, English |\n| Cochrane       | (\u0022intervention\u0022 OR \u0022treatment\u0022) AND \u0022outcome\u0022 | AND, OR            | Date: 2000-2018, English |\n| Embase         | (\u0022intervention\u0022 OR \u0022treatment\u0022) AND \u0022outcome\u0022 | AND, OR            | Date: 2000-2018, English |\n\n#### Eligibility Criteria\n- **Inclusion Criteria**:\n  - Study Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\n  - Population: Adults aged 18-65\n  - Intervention: Specific treatment X\n  - Comparison: Placebo or standard care\n  - Outcomes: Primary outcome Y, secondary outcome Z\n\n- **Exclusion Criteria**:\n  - Non-English language studies\n  - Studies with high risk of bias\n  - Studies published before 2000\n\n### Next Steps\nOnce you have obtained and documented the original search strategies and eligibility criteria, you can proceed with updating the review. This will involve:\n1. **Conducting a New Search**: Use the same search strategies but update the date range to cover the period since the original review.\n2. **Screening and Selection**: Apply the same eligibility criteria to screen and select new studies.\n3. **Data Extraction and Synthesis**: Extract data from the new studies and synthesize it with the existing data from the original review.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure a thorough and systematic update of the review, maintaining the rigor and reliability of the original work."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
