  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "The PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) checklist is a valuable tool for ensuring that systematic review search strategies are well-structured and comprehensive before conducting a full review. Below, I will guide you through the PRESS checklist, which consists of several key domains. You can use this as a framework to peer review your search strategy.\n\n### PRESS Checklist\n\n1. **Search Strategy Details**\n   - **Complete details of the search strategy should be provided.**\n   - Ensure that your search strategy is written clearly and includes all components: keywords, subject headings, Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), and any other relevant syntax specific to the database being searched.\n\n2. **Database Selection**\n   - **Justify the databases that have been selected for the search.**\n   - You should explain the rationale for choosing specific databases based on your research question and the disciplines involved.\n\n3. **PICO Elements**\n   - **The search should reflect the key components of the study\u0027s PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework, if applicable.**\n   - Ensure that your search terms are aligned with your specific PICO elements to capture relevant literature.\n\n4. **Search Terms Consistency**\n   - **Verify that the search terms used are consistent and that synonyms and variations are included.**\n   - Check that you have included relevant synonyms, acronyms, and related terms for each keyword to enhance the comprehensiveness of the search.\n\n5. **Use of Controlled Vocabulary**\n   - **Incorporate controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms in PubMed) where appropriate.**\n   - Make sure that your search strategy utilizes any relevant controlled vocabulary to improve precision.\n\n6. **Limitations and Filters**\n   - **Appropriate limits or filters (e.g., date, language) should be transparently applied.**\n   - Clearly state any limits applied to the search and justify why these were necessary.\n\n7. **Pilot Testing**\n   - **Consider conducting a pilot search to refine the search strategy before full implementation.**\n   - If you have already performed a trial search, summarize the results and adjustments made based on findings, if any.\n\n8. **Results Reporting**\n   - **Establish a clear method for reporting the results of the search process (e.g., PRISMA flow diagram).**\n   - Plan to clearly document your search results, including the number of records identified, screened, and included/excluded, according to the PRISMA guidelines.\n\n9. **Study Selection**\n   - **Outline a clear process for study selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria.**\n   - Ensure you have defined criteria for including or excluding studies from your review based on the search results.\n\n10. **Tuning and Review Process**\n    - **Identify who will be involved in the peer review of the search strategy and their qualifications.**\n    - Clarify who will conduct the peer review of the search strategy and ensure this individual has the appropriate expertise in systematic reviews.\n\n### Implementing the Checklist\n\n- **Draft your search strategy**: Write out the full search strategy you intend to use, including keywords, connectors, and any filters or limits applied.\n- **Review against the PRESS checklist**: Go through each item on the checklist and assess whether your search strategy meets the criteria.\n- **Seek feedback**: Share your search strategy and the checklist with your peers or mentors for their input and suggestions.\n- **Revise as needed**: Incorporate any feedback and make necessary revisions to improve your search strategy.\n- **Document changes**: Keep a record of changes made to the search strategy for transparency.\n\nBy following this PRESS checklist and these guidance points, you will be better prepared for a peer review of your search strategy, ultimately improving the quality and rigor of your systematic review.", "Gemini": "This is an excellent and crucial step for any systematic review! Peer review of your search strategy using the PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) checklist significantly enhances the quality, comprehensiveness, and reproducibility of your review.\n\nHere\u0027s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate this process:\n\n---\n\n## Guide to Peer-Reviewing Your Systematic Review Search Strategy Using PRESS\n\nThe PRESS checklist is designed to improve the quality of systematic review search strategies. It provides a structured approach for an experienced information specialist or librarian to review your planned search.\n\n**Goal:** To ensure your search strategy is comprehensive, accurate, reproducible, and aligns with your review\u0027s objectives before you invest time and resources in screening results.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation (By You, the Searcher/Review Team)\n\nBefore you even approach a peer reviewer, you need to have your materials in order. The more complete and clear your documentation, the more effective the peer review will be.\n\n1.  **Develop Your Research Question (PICO/PEO):**\n    *   Clearly define your Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C), Outcome (O) \u2013 or Population (P), Exposure (E), Outcome (O) for qualitative/observational reviews.\n    *   This is the foundation of your search.\n\n2.  **Draft Your Review Protocol:**\n    *   Though not the focus of the search review, having a draft protocol (or at least key sections like inclusion/exclusion criteria) provides essential context for the reviewer.\n    *   Mention specific eligibility criteria (e.g., date limits, language limits, study designs).\n\n3.  **Identify Key Concepts for Each PICO Element:**\n    *   Brainstorm all possible terms, synonyms, related concepts, acronyms, and alternative spellings for each element of your PICO.\n\n4.  **Develop a Preliminary Search Strategy for Each Database:**\n    *   **Start with one primary database (e.g., MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase) and develop a robust strategy there first.** This strategy will then be adapted for other databases.\n    *   **Use appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH for PubMed/MEDLINE, Emtree for Embase) AND free-text terms (keywords).**\n    *   **Combine terms using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT).**\n    *   **Utilize truncation (\u0060*\u0060), wildcards (\u0060?\u0060), proximity operators (\u0060adj\u0060, \u0060N\u0060), and field codes (e.g., \u0060[tiab]\u0060 for title/abstract).**\n    *   **Document EVERYTHING:** The exact syntax, database platform (e.g., Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection), date of strategy development.\n\n5.  **Compile a List of \u0022Gold Standard\u0022 or Benchmark Papers:**\n    *   Identify 3-5 highly relevant, seminal papers that you know *must* be retrieved by your search. These will be used to test the recall of your strategy.\n    *   Provide their full citations (author, title, journal, year).\n\n6.  **Organize Your Materials:**\n    *   Create a single document or folder that contains:\n        *   Your PICO/PEO question.\n        *   Brief overview of inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n        *   Your preliminary search strategies for each planned database (ideally starting with the most developed one).\n        *   Your list of \u0022gold standard\u0022 papers.\n        *   Any rationale for specific term choices or search syntax decisions.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Selecting a Peer Reviewer\n\nThe quality of the review depends on the reviewer\u0027s expertise.\n\n1.  **Identify a Qualified Reviewer:**\n    *   **An experienced information specialist or librarian** with expertise in systematic review methodology and searching.\n    *   Someone who is *not* part of your immediate review team to ensure an objective perspective.\n    *   Ideally, someone who uses the databases you plan to search regularly.\n    *   **Where to find them:** University librarians, hospital librarians, professional library associations, or by networking with other systematic review teams.\n\n2.  **Initiate Contact:**\n    *   Clearly explain your request, the timeline, and the scope of the review (i.e., focus on the search strategy using PRESS).\n    *   Be respectful of their time and offer appropriate acknowledgment in your final review.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: The Peer Review Process (Using the PRESS Checklist)\n\nOnce you\u0027ve identified a reviewer and prepared your materials, share them. The reviewer will use the PRESS checklist as their guide.\n\n#### **Understanding the PRESS Checklist Categories (and what the reviewer will be looking for, and you should anticipate):**\n\nThe PRESS 2015 Guideline consists of **6 main categories** with detailed items for each. While the reviewer will fill out the checklist, you, as the searcher, should understand what each category addresses.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 1: Documentation (D)**\n*   **What it addresses:** The clarity, completeness, and reproducibility of the documented search strategy.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **D1 - Database Name/Platform:** Are the specific names of the databases and search platforms (e.g., Ovid MEDLINE vs. PubMed) clearly stated?\n    *   **D2 - Date:** Is the date the search strategy was developed/run included?\n    *   **D3 - Searcher Name:** Is the name of the person who created the strategy included? (Less critical for peer review, but good practice).\n    *   **D4 - Full Search Strategy:** Is the entire, line-by-line strategy provided for *each* database?\n    *   **D5 - Translation:** If the strategy was translated across databases, is the original (e.g., MEDLINE) strategy clearly marked?\n    *   **D6 - Comments/Notes:** Are there any notes explaining rationale, specific decisions, or limitations?\n*   **Your takeaway:** Ensure your search strategy document is a standalone, clear, and complete record for each database.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 2: Concepts (C)**\n*   **What it addresses:** Whether all PICO/PEO elements are represented and adequately covered with appropriate terms.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **C1 - Concepts Included:** Are all PICO/PEO concepts represented in the search strategy?\n    *   **C2 - Controlled Vocabulary:** Has relevant controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH, Emtree, CINAHL headings) been used appropriately for each concept?\n    *   **C3 - Keywords/Free-text Terms:** Have sufficient keywords/free-text terms been used for each concept, including synonyms, acronyms, and relevant phrases?\n    *   **C4 - Truncation/Wildcards:** Are truncation and wildcards used effectively to capture variations (e.g., \u0060child*\u0060 for child, children, childhood)? Are they used too broadly?\n    *   **C5 - Spelling Variations:** Have common spelling variations (e.g., British vs. American English) been considered?\n    *   **C6 - Proximity Operators:** Are proximity operators (e.g., \u0060ADJ\u0060, \u0060NEAR\u0060) used where appropriate to increase precision without losing recall?\n    *   **C7 - Exclusion Terms:** Are there any terms that should be *excluded* using \u0060NOT\u0060 to improve precision without missing relevant articles? (Use \u0060NOT\u0060 cautiously).\n*   **Your takeaway:** Critically evaluate if you\u0027ve cast a wide enough net for each concept, balancing recall and precision.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 3: Logic (L)**\n*   **What it addresses:** The correct application of Boolean operators, nesting, and field codes.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **L1 - Boolean Operators:** Are AND/OR/NOT operators used correctly to combine concepts and terms?\n    *   **L2 - Nesting/Parentheses:** Is nesting used correctly to group terms and ensure proper order of operations? (e.g., \u0060(term A OR term B) AND (term C OR term D)\u0060).\n    *   **L3 - Field Codes:** Are appropriate field codes (e.g., \u0060[tiab]\u0060, \u0060[mh]\u0060, \u0060[pt]\u0060) used for each term or line?\n    *   **L4 - Syntax:** Is the overall syntax correct for the specific database and platform being used? (e.g., PubMed syntax differs from Ovid).\n    *   **L5 - Limits/Filters:** Are any limits or filters (e.g., publication date, language, study type) applied appropriately and documented? Are they too restrictive?\n*   **Your takeaway:** Precision is key here. One misplaced parenthesis or incorrect field code can significantly alter your results.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 4: Appropriateness (A)**\n*   **What it addresses:** The suitability of the overall strategy for the review question and database choice.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **A1 - Database Selection:** Are the chosen databases appropriate and sufficient for the research question? (e.g., MEDLINE for health, PsycINFO for psychology, Web of Science for broader citations).\n    *   **A2 - \u0022Gold Standard\u0022 Papers:** Does the strategy successfully retrieve the \u0022gold standard\u0022 papers you provided? If not, why? This is a critical check.\n    *   **A3 - Scope:** Is the search too broad (retrieving too much irrelevant material) or too narrow (missing relevant articles)?\n    *   **A4 - Other Sources:** Are other search methods (e.g., hand-searching, grey literature, citation chaining) considered if appropriate for the review?\n*   **Your takeaway:** This category validates the *effectiveness* of your strategy. The gold standard papers are your litmus test.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 5: Clarity of Presentation (P)**\n*   **What it addresses:** How easy it is for others (and your future self!) to understand and interpret the strategy.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **P1 - Readability:** Is the strategy well-formatted and easy to read? (e.g., consistent indentation, clear line numbering).\n    *   **P2 - Logical Grouping:** Are related terms grouped logically?\n    *   **P3 - Comments:** Are there sufficient comments to explain complex parts of the strategy?\n*   **Your takeaway:** A well-presented strategy is easier to review, replicate, and report.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS Checklist Category 6: Overall Assessment (O)**\n*   **What it addresses:** The reviewer\u0027s overall impression and any final recommendations.\n*   **Reviewer will check for:**\n    *   **O1 - General Impression:** What is the reviewer\u0027s overall assessment of the search strategy (e.g., excellent, good, needs major revisions)?\n    *   **O2 - Major Recommendations:** Any critical issues that must be addressed.\n    *   **O3 - Minor Recommendations:** Suggestions for improvement, but not critical flaws.\n    *   **O4 - Confidence:** How confident is the reviewer that the strategy will retrieve relevant articles?\n*   **Your takeaway:** This is the summary feedback. Be open to all recommendations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Responding to Feedback (By You)\n\n1.  **Receive and Review Feedback:**\n    *   Read through the completed PRESS checklist and any additional comments from the reviewer carefully.\n    *   Don\u0027t take criticism personally; it\u0027s about improving the review.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Changes:**\n    *   Address critical issues (e.g., missing PICO concepts, incorrect Boolean logic that drastically alters results) first.\n    *   Then, consider minor suggestions that will improve precision or recall.\n\n3.  **Implement Revisions:**\n    *   Make the necessary changes to your search strategy in each database.\n    *   Re-run your \u0022gold standard\u0022 papers test if significant changes were made.\n\n4.  **Document Your Changes:**\n    *   Keep a clear record of all changes made in response to the peer review. This is important for transparency and for your final reporting. You might create a table listing \u0022Reviewer Suggestion\u0022 and \u0022Your Action/Response.\u0022\n\n5.  **Communicate with the Reviewer (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   If there were complex issues or if you have questions about their feedback, follow up with the reviewer.\n    *   Thank them for their time and valuable input.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Finalization \u0026 Documentation\n\n1.  **Finalize Strategies:** Once satisfied with all revisions, your search strategies are ready to be executed.\n2.  **Execute Searches:** Run your finalized strategies in each planned database.\n3.  **Document Results:** Record the number of hits from each database and the date each search was run.\n4.  **Report in Your Review:** In your systematic review, be sure to:\n    *   Describe the peer review process.\n    *   Mention that the PRESS checklist was used.\n    *   Acknowledge the information specialist/librarian who conducted the review.\n    *   Include your final, complete search strategies (often in an appendix or supplementary material).\n\n---\n\nBy following this structured approach, you will significantly enhance the quality and robustness of your systematic review\u0027s search strategy, a foundational element for a successful review. Good luck!", "Mistral": "Certainly! The PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) checklist is a valuable tool for ensuring that your search strategy is comprehensive and well-designed. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare your search strategy for peer review using the PRESS checklist:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the PRESS Checklist\nThe PRESS checklist includes six key components:\n1. **Translation of the Research Question**\n2. **Boolean and Proximity Operators**\n3. **Subject Headings**\n4. **Text Words**\n5. **Spelling, Syntax, and Line Numbers**\n6. **Limits and Filters**\n\n### Step 2: Develop Your Search Strategy\nBefore you can use the PRESS checklist, you need to have a draft of your search strategy. This typically includes:\n- **Research Question**: Clearly define your research question.\n- **Databases**: Identify the databases you will search (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library).\n- **Keywords and Subject Headings**: List the keywords, synonyms, and subject headings (e.g., MeSH terms) you will use.\n- **Search Strings**: Develop the search strings for each database, including Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and proximity operators.\n- **Filters and Limits**: Decide on any filters or limits (e.g., date range, language, study type).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the PRESS Checklist\nUse the PRESS checklist to review your search strategy. Here\u2019s how to apply each component:\n\n#### 1. Translation of the Research Question\n- **Check**: Ensure that your search strategy accurately reflects your research question.\n- **Example**: If your research question is about the effectiveness of a specific intervention, make sure your search terms cover the intervention, the population, and the outcomes.\n\n#### 2. Boolean and Proximity Operators\n- **Check**: Verify that you are using Boolean operators correctly to combine search terms.\n- **Example**: Use OR to combine synonyms and AND to combine different concepts.\n\n#### 3. Subject Headings\n- **Check**: Ensure that you have included relevant subject headings (e.g., MeSH terms in PubMed).\n- **Example**: For a study on diabetes, include MeSH terms like \u0022Diabetes Mellitus.\u0022\n\n#### 4. Text Words\n- **Check**: Make sure you have included a comprehensive list of text words and synonyms.\n- **Example**: For a study on diabetes, include terms like \u0022diabetes,\u0022 \u0022diabetic,\u0022 \u0022hyperglycemia,\u0022 etc.\n\n#### 5.
