  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Finding pediatric studies on sleep interventions can sometimes be challenging due to the prevalence of adult-focused literature. Here are some strategies you can employ, including using age-specific search filters like the Cochrane Pediatric Filter:\n\n### 1. Use Age-Specific Search Filters\n\nWhen searching databases, apply filters specifically designed for pediatric populations. The Cochrane Pediatric Filter and similar filters can help narrow your results. While the actual filter may vary between databases, here\u2019s a generic example of how to adjust your search:\n\n- **Cochrane Library**: Use keywords such as \u0022pediatric sleep interventions\u0022 and apply filters for children and adolescents.\n- **PubMed**: You can either rely on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms or use specific age ranges in your search. Use \u201CChild\u201D (age 0-12 years) or \u201CAdolescent\u201D (age 13-18 years) in your queries.\n- **CINAHL**: Set the age filters to \u201CChild\u201D, \u201CAdolescent\u201D, and \u201CInfant\u201D for more targeted results.\n\n**Example Search:**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\u0022sleep intervention\u0022 AND (\u0022Child\u0022[MeSH] OR \u0022Adolescent\u0022[MeSH] OR \u0022Infant\u0022[MeSH])\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### 2. Search Terms\n\nMake sure you are using appropriate keywords. Here are some suggested search terms:\n- Sleep interventions in children\n- Pediatric sleep disorders\n- Child sleep therapy\n- Behavioral sleep interventions in children\n- Sleep hygiene practices for children\n\n### 3. Databases\n\nUse specialized databases in addition to general ones:\n- **Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews**: Look for systematic reviews related to sleep interventions in children.\n- **PubMed**: Use the advanced search options to filter studies by age.\n- **PsycINFO**: For psychological aspects of sleep interventions in children and adolescents.\n- **Embase**: This database also has a range of pediatric studies, often not covered in PubMed.\n\n### 4. Recent Reviews\n\nLook for recent systematic reviews or meta-analyses that focus on pediatric sleep interventions. These usually summarize a range of studies and can guide you to specific research.\n\n### 5. Pediatric Journals\n\nConsider browsing journals specifically focused on pediatrics or child health, such as:\n- **Pediatrics**\n- **Journal of Pediatric Psychology**\n- **Sleep Medicine Reviews**\n- **Child and Adolescent Mental Health**\n\n### 6. Consult Libraries/Experts\n\nReach out to a medical library or a professional in pediatric sleep medicine for help. They might have access to resources or databases not readily available online.\n\n### 7. Keywords Across Different Studies\n\nIdentify keywords and subject headings used in relevant studies you find. Use these to refine your searches.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you should be able to find more targeted studies on sleep interventions specifically for pediatric populations. If you need help constructing a specific search or if you want assistance with a particular database, feel free to ask!", "Gemini": "You\u0027re running into a common challenge! Pediatric research often gets overshadowed by adult studies, and effective age-specific filtering is key.\n\nLet\u0027s break down how to effectively use age-specific filters, especially the Cochrane pediatric filter, and build a robust search strategy for pediatric sleep interventions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Using the Cochrane Pediatric Filter\n\nThe \u0022Cochrane pediatric filter\u0022 isn\u0027t a single clickable button, but rather a **pre-defined, validated search strategy** (a set of terms and Boolean operators) designed to retrieve studies on children, infants, and adolescents. It combines controlled vocabulary (like MeSH terms) with keywords to maximize sensitivity and specificity for pediatric populations.\n\nHere\u0027s how to use it and a common version:\n\n**A. How to Use it in the Cochrane Library:**\n\n1.  **Go to the Cochrane Library:** [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/)\n2.  **Navigate to Advanced Search:** Look for \u0022Advanced Search\u0022 or \u0022Search Manager\u0022 on the homepage.\n3.  **Copy and Paste the Pediatric Filter:**\n    You\u0027ll enter this into one of the search boxes (often labeled \u0022Add a search term\u0022 or similar). This specific filter aims to capture a broad range of pediatric ages.\n\n    **Common Cochrane Pediatric Search Filter (Example - you might need to adapt slightly for specific databases or if Cochrane has an updated version):**\n\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    (child OR children OR pediatric OR paediatric OR infant OR infants OR neonate OR neonatal OR newborn OR toddler OR toddlers OR adolescent OR adolescents OR school age OR \u0022school-age\u0022 OR \u0022young adult*\u0022 OR \u0022juvenile\u0022 OR \u0022juveniles\u0022 OR \u0022preschool\u0022 OR \u0022pre-school\u0022 OR \u0022schoolchild\u0022 OR \u0022school-child\u0022 OR \u0022teenager\u0022 OR \u0022teenagers\u0022 OR \u0022childhood\u0022) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Child] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Infant] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Adolescent] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Pediatrics] expl)\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    *   **Explanation:**\n        *   \u0060OR\u0060 connects all the different terms for children/age groups, ensuring you catch any of them.\n        *   \u0060*\u0060 (truncation) captures variations (e.g., \u0060adolescent*\u0060 gets adolescent, adolescents).\n        *   \u0060\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [X] expl\u0060 uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary, expanding (expl) to include all narrower terms under \u0022Child,\u0022 \u0022Infant,\u0022 \u0022Adolescent,\u0022 and \u0022Pediatrics.\u0022 This is highly effective.\n        *   For the Cochrane Library, the exact syntax for MeSH terms might be \u0060[Mesh]Child\u0060 or similar. The Cochrane database automatically maps many keywords to MeSH, but explicitly using \u0060[MeSH descriptor:X]\u0060 is safer.\n\n4.  **Combine with Your Intervention/Outcome Terms:**\n    Once you\u0027ve run the pediatric filter (e.g., as \u0022Search #1\u0022), you\u0027ll then combine it with your terms for \u0022sleep intervention\u0022 and \u0022sleep outcome\u0022 using \u0060AND\u0060.\n\n    **Example Steps in Cochrane\u0027s Advanced Search:**\n    *   **Search 1:** \u0060(child OR children OR pediatric OR paediatric OR infant OR infants OR neonate OR neonatal OR newborn OR toddler OR toddlers OR adolescent OR adolescents OR school age OR \u0022school-age\u0022 OR \u0022young adult*\u0022 OR \u0022juvenile\u0022 OR \u0022juveniles\u0022 OR \u0022preschool\u0022 OR \u0022pre-school\u0022 OR \u0022schoolchild\u0022 OR \u0022school-child\u0022 OR \u0022teenager\u0022 OR \u0022teenagers\u0022 OR \u0022childhood\u0022) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Child] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Infant] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Adolescent] expl) OR (\u0022MeSH descriptor\u0022: [Pediatrics] expl)\u0060\n    *   **Search 2 (Sleep Intervention Terms):** \u0060(sleep adj3 (intervent* OR therap* OR treatment* OR program* OR education* OR CBT-I OR \u0022cognitive behavioral\u0022 OR \u0022behavioral sleep\u0022 OR hygiene OR melatonin OR \u0022light therapy\u0022 OR \u0022parent training\u0022))\u0060\n    *   **Search 3 (Sleep Outcome Terms - Optional, but good for focus):** \u0060(sleep OR insomnia OR \u0022sleep disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022sleep quality\u0022 OR \u0022sleep duration\u0022 OR \u0022sleep latency\u0022 OR \u0022night awakenings\u0022 OR parasomnia*)\u0060\n    *   **Search 4 (Final Combination):** \u0060#1 AND #2 AND #3\u0060 (or \u0060#1 AND #2\u0060 if you find #3 too restrictive initially).\n\n**B. Where to Find Official Cochrane Filters:**\nCochrane often publishes its specific, up-to-date filters for various topics (including age, study types, etc.) in their methodology chapters or on their website. If you\u0027re doing a full systematic review, it\u0027s always best to check the latest recommended filters directly from the Cochrane Handbook or their official resources. A quick Google search for \u0022Cochrane pediatric search filter\u0022 usually leads to their specific guidance.\n\n---\n\n### 2. General Age-Specific Search Filters (Beyond Cochrane)\n\nMost major bibliographic databases offer robust age-specific filtering options.\n\n**A. Using Keywords for Age:**\n\nThis is the simplest starting point and should always be included, as not all studies are perfectly indexed with controlled vocabulary.\n\n*   \u0060child*\u0060 (captures child, children, childhood)\n*   \u0060pediatric\u0060 OR \u0060paediatric\u0060 (use both spellings!)\n*   \u0060infant*\u0060 (infant, infancy)\n*   \u0060neonate*\u0060 OR \u0060newborn*\u0060\n*   \u0060toddler*\u0060\n*   \u0060adolescent*\u0060 OR \u0060teen*\u0060 OR \u0060juvenile*\u0060\n*   \u0060\u0022school age\u0022\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022school-age\u0022\u0060\n*   \u0060\u0022preschool\u0022\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022pre-school\u0022\u0060\n*   You can also specify age ranges: \u0060\u00220-18 years\u0022\u0060 OR \u0060\u00220-12 years\u0022\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022birth-18\u0022\u0060 etc.\n\n**B. Using Controlled Vocabulary (MeSH, Emtree, PsycINFO Thesaurus):**\n\nThese are powerful and more precise than keywords alone because they map to a standardized concept, regardless of the author\u0027s exact phrasing.\n\n*   **PubMed (using MeSH - Medical Subject Headings):**\n    *   Go to PubMed.\n    *   In your search query, use terms like:\n        *   \u0060\u0022Child\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (0-18 years)\n        *   \u0060\u0022Infant\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (1-23 months)\n        *   \u0060\u0022Infant, Newborn\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (0-1 month)\n        *   \u0060\u0022Child, Preschool\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (2-5 years)\n        *   \u0060\u0022Child\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (6-12 years \u2013 *note: the \u0022Child\u0022 MeSH term covers 6-12 generally, but the broader \u0022Child\u0022 entry covers 0-18. It\u0027s often best to use the more specific terms or let the \u0022Child\u0022[Mesh] term explode for full coverage*)\n        *   \u0060\u0022Adolescent\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 (13-18 years)\n    *   **Tip:** You can often just type \u0060child\u0060 into the PubMed search bar and then use the \u0022Filters\u0022 on the left-hand side to select specific age groups (e.g., \u0022Child: 0-18 years,\u0022 \u0022Infant: 0-23 months,\u0022 \u0022Adolescent: 13-18 years\u0022). This is often the easiest way in PubMed.\n\n*   **Embase (using Emtree):**\n    *   Similar to MeSH, Emtree has specific terms like \u0060child\u0060, \u0060infant\u0060, \u0060adolescent\u0060, \u0060newborn\u0060. You\u0027ll typically search for \u0060child/exp\u0060 (to explode the term and include narrower categories).\n    *   Embase also has dedicated age filters in its advanced search interface.\n\n*   **PsycINFO (using Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms):**\n    *   \u0060Children\u0060\n    *   \u0060Infants\u0060\n    *   \u0060Adolescents\u0060\n    *   \u0060Preschool Age\u0060\n    *   \u0060School Age\u0060\n\n**C. Using Database-Specific Filters:**\n\nMost databases have built-in filters usually found on the left-hand sidebar after you perform an initial search.\n\n*   **PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO:** Look for sections like:\n    *   \u0060Age\u0060\n    *   \u0060Patient Age\u0060\n    *   \u0060Population\u0060\n    *   \u0060Subjects\u0060\n    *   You\u0027ll typically see checkboxes or dropdowns for \u0022Child,\u0022 \u0022Infant,\u0022 \u0022Adolescent,\u0022 \u0022Preschooler,\u0022 \u0022School age,\u0022 etc.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

These often provide a great overview and can point you to many primary studies.\n*   **Test and Iterate:** Your first search won\u0027t be perfect. Review a sample of results, see what terms they use, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n*   **Consult a Librarian:** For complex systematic reviews, a research librarian is an invaluable resource for refining search strategies.\n\nBy combining specific age terms, controlled vocabulary, and database filters, you should significantly improve your ability to find pediatric sleep intervention studies!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
