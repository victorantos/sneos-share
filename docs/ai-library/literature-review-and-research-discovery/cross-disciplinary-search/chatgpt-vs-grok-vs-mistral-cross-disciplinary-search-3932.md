It explores how brain processes inform learning, teaching methods, and cognitive development. Below, I\u0027ll identify key multidisciplinary databases, starting with PubMed as you mentioned, and explain their relevance. These are widely used, peer-reviewed resources accessible via academic institutions, libraries, or open-access portals. I\u0027ve focused on those with strong coverage of interdisciplinary research.\n\n#### 1. **PubMed (Biomedical and Life Sciences Focus)**\n   - **Description**: Maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), it indexes millions of citations from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Search for terms like \u0022educational neuroscience,\u0022 \u0022brain-based learning,\u0022 or \u0022neuroplasticity in education.\u0022\n   - **Relevance**: Excellent for neuroscientific aspects, such as studies on neural correlates of learning (e.g., fMRI research on memory in classrooms). Covers journals like *Neuron* and *Journal of Neuroscience*.\n   - **Access**: Free via pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; advanced via PubMed Central for full texts.\n   - **Tip**: Use MeSH terms like \u0022Learning\u0022 combined with \u0022Neurosciences\u0022 for precise results.\n\n#### 2. **PsycINFO (Psychology and Behavioral Sciences)**\n   - **Description**: Produced by the American Psychological Association (APA), it covers psychological literature, including experimental, educational, and developmental psychology.\n   - **Relevance**: Bridges neuroscience with education through topics like cognitive development, motivation, and learning disorders (e.g., ADHD from a neuro-educational lens). Includes reviews on how brain imaging informs pedagogical strategies.\n   - **Access**: Subscription-based (via APA PsycNet or university libraries); abstracts are often free.\n   - **Tip**: Filter for \u0022neuroscience\u0022 subfields to find intersections with educational applications.\n\n#### 3. **ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)**\n   - **Description**: Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, it indexes education-related research from journals, reports, and conference papers.\n   - **Relevance**: Strong on applied educational topics, including neuroscience-informed teaching (e.g., brain-compatible instruction, literacy development via neuroimaging). Complements PubMed by focusing on classroom implications rather than pure biology.\n   - **Access**: Free via eric.ed.gov; full texts often linked to open sources.\n   - **Tip**: Search for \u0022neuroscience education\u0022 to pull in policy reports and empirical studies on school interventions.\n\n#### 4. **Web of Science (Multidisciplinary Core Collection)**\n   - **Description**: Clarivate\u0027s database indexes high-impact journals across sciences, social sciences, and arts/humanities, with citation tracking.\n   - **Relevance**: Ideal for interdisciplinary work; track how neuroscience papers are cited in education journals (e.g., emerging field of \u0022mind, brain, and education\u0022). Covers emerging subfields like neuroethics in schooling.\n   - **Access**: Subscription-based (common in universities); includes tools for bibliometric analysis.\n   - **Tip**: Use the \u0022Emerging Sources Citation Index\u0022 for newer educational neuroscience publications.\n\n#### 5. **Scopus (Multidisciplinary Abstract and Citation Database)**\n   - **Description**: Elsevier\u0027s platform indexing over 80 million records from scientific, technical, medical, and social science journals.\n   - **Relevance**: Broad coverage of cognitive neuroscience applied to education, including global perspectives (e.g., cultural differences in brain plasticity for learning). Good for meta-analyses linking neuro findings to educational outcomes.\n   - **Access**: Subscription-based; some open-access content available.\n   - **Tip**: Leverage its affiliation search to find researchers at intersections like Harvard\u0027s Mind, Brain, and Education program.\n\n#### 6. **Google Scholar (Broad, Free Search Engine)**\n   - **Description**: Google\u0027s academic search tool, indexing scholarly articles, theses, books, and preprints from across the web.\n   - **Relevance**: Catches interdisciplinary gems not in paywalled databases, like preprints on neurofeedback in tutoring or open-access reviews from *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*. Useful for tracking citations in real-time.\n   - **Access**: Free at scholar.google.com; set up alerts for keywords.\n   - **Tip**: Use advanced search for \u0022educational neuroscience\u0022 with date filters to focus on recent developments (post-2010 boom in the field).\n\n#### Additional Recommendations\n- **Specialized Sources**: For deeper dives, check *Cognitive Neuroscience Society* archives or the *International Mind, Brain, and Education Society* (IMBES) journal (*Mind, Brain, and Education*), often indexed in the above. Also, explore Neuroscience-specific databases like *Neuroscience Abstracts* (via ProQuest) if focusing on brain imaging.\n- **Search Strategy**: Combine keywords like \u0022neuroeducation,\u0022 \u0022learning sciences,\u0022 \u0022cognitive load theory,\u0022 or \u0022neural mechanisms of instruction.\u0022 Use Boolean operators (AND/OR) and limit to reviews for overviews.\n- **Access Tips**: If you\u0027re affiliated with a university, use their library portal for seamless access. For free options, prioritize PubMed, ERIC, and Google Scholar. Tools like Zotero or EndNote can help organize results.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for your research.
