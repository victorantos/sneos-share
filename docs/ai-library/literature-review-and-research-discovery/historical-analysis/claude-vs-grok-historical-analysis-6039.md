Key phases include:\n\n- **1950s\u20131960s**: Post-WWII focus on scientific management refinements (e.g., Taylorism\u0027s legacy) and human relations (e.g., Mayo\u0027s Hawthorne studies). Emergence of behavioral approaches.\n- **1970s\u20131980s**: Contingency and systems theories (e.g., Burns \u0026 Stalker\u0027s mechanistic-organic distinction; Lawrence \u0026 Lorsch\u0027s contingency model). Institutional and population ecology perspectives.\n- **1990s\u20132000s**: Resource-based view, knowledge management, and network theories. Influence of globalization and postmodern critiques.\n- **2010s\u2013Present**: Emphasis on agility, resilience, AI integration, and DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) in organizations. Recent works address hybrid work and sustainability post-COVID.\n\nThis evolution reflects broader societal changes, from industrialization to the knowledge economy and digital age. For your analysis, focus on seminal texts, meta-analyses, and review articles to trace debates and paradigm shifts.\n\n### Recommended Databases for Searching Historical Literature\n\nTo ensure full date coverage (1950\u2013present) with comprehensive indexing of academic journals, books, and dissertations, use these scholarly databases. Most provide filters for publication date, allowing you to restrict searches to 1950 onward. Prioritize peer-reviewed sources for reliability. If you don\u0027t have institutional access (e.g., via a university), many offer free abstracts, with full texts available through Google Scholar or library interloans.\n\n1. **JSTOR** (jstor.org):\n   - **Why it\u0027s ideal**: Extensive archive of social sciences and humanities journals, with strong coverage of business and management from the 1950s. Includes historical scans of older issues.\n   - **Search tips**: Use keywords like \u0022organizational theory evolution\u0022 OR \u0022organizational behavior history\u0022 with date filter (1950\u20132023). Access: Free registration for limited reads; full via academic login.\n   - **Strengths**: Digitized back issues; interdisciplinary (e.g., sociology of organizations).\n\n2. **Business Source Complete (via EBSCOhost)** (ebsco.com/products/research-databases/business-source-complete):\n   - **Why it\u0027s ideal**: Comprehensive for management literature, indexing 1,200\u002B journals from the 1950s, including classics like *Administrative Science Quarterly* and *Academy of Management Review*.\n   - **Search tips**: Advanced search with subject terms \u0022organizational theory\u0022 AND \u0022historical review\u0022 \u002B date range. Includes case studies and book chapters.\n   - **Strengths**: Full-text access to 10,000\u002B books; global coverage, including non-English sources.\n\n3. **Web of Science** (webofscience.com) or **Scopus** (scopus.com):\n   - **Why it\u0027s ideal**: Citation databases with precise historical tracking via cited references. Web of Science covers social sciences from 1956; Scopus from 1970 but indexes earlier via cross-references.\n   - **Search tips**: Topic search: \u0022organizational theory\u0022 AND \u0022evolution\u0022 OR \u0022development\u0022 1950\u20132023. Use citation analysis to trace influence (e.g., who cites Simon\u0027s 1950s works?).\n   - **Strengths**: Citation networks reveal theoretical shifts; exportable bibliometrics for your analysis.\n\n4. **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com) as a supplement:\n   - **Why it\u0027s ideal**: Free, broad coverage including grey literature and books. Set custom date range under \u0022Advanced Search.\u0022\n   - **Search tips**: \u0022organizational theory\u0022 \u0022historical overview\u0022 filetype:pdf since 1950. Use \u0022Cited by\u0022 to follow evolutions.\n   - **Strengths**: Uncovers open-access articles; links to full texts via PDFs or DOIs.\n\n5. **ProQuest Dissertations \u0026 Theses Global** (proquest.com) or **Google Books** (books.google.com):\n   - **Why it\u0027s ideal**: For theses (dissertations often review historical literature) and scanned books from the 1950s onward.\n   - **Search tips**: \u0022history of organizational theory\u0022 \u002B date filter. Google Books previews historical editions (e.g., Drucker\u2019s 1954 *The Practice of Management*).\n\n**General Search Strategy**:\n- **Keywords/Phrases**: Combine \u0022organizational theory\u0022 with \u0022history,\u0022 \u0022evolution,\u0022 \u0022development,\u0022 \u0022paradigm shift,\u0022 or era-specific terms (e.g., \u0022contingency theory 1960s\u0022 OR \u0022institutional theory 1990s\u0022).\n- **Boolean Operators**: (\u0022organizational theory\u0022 OR \u0022organization studies\u0022) AND (history OR evolution) AND (1950 OR 1960*).\n- **Filters**: Peer-reviewed only; English (or expand languages); sort by date to trace chronology.\n- **Tools for Coverage**: Use Zotero or EndNote for managing references; employ bibliometric software like VOSviewer (free) to map theoretical networks over time.\n- **Potential Challenges**: Pre-1970s coverage may be sparser in digital formats\u2014supplement with physical libraries or HathiTrust (hathitrust.org) for public-domain scans.\n\n### Key Foundational and Review Sources (Based on Database Queries)\n\nFrom a simulated search across these databases (drawing on well-known indices), here are pivotal works to anchor your analysis.
