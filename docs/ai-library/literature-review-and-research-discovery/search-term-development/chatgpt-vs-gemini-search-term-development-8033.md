Getting your search terms right will make a huge difference in the quality and comprehensiveness of your results. Let\u0027s break it down by category and then look at how to combine them.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Brainstorm Synonyms and Related Terms\n\nWe\u0027ll categorize them into the main concepts: **Social Media**, **Adolescents**, **Mental Health**, and **Impact/Relationship Terms**.\n\n---\n\n#### A. Social Media (and related digital platforms/behaviors)\n\n*   **Core Terms:**\n    *   Social media\n    *   Social networking\n    *   Online platforms\n    *   Digital media\n    *   Internet use\n    *   Screen time\n    *   Smartphone use\n    *   Mobile phone use\n    *   Digital technology\n    *   Online communication\n\n*   **Specific Platforms (consider including key ones, especially for recent research):**\n    *   Facebook\n    *   Instagram\n    *   TikTok\n    *   Snapchat\n    *   Twitter (or X)\n    *   YouTube\n    *   Reddit\n    *   Discord\n    *   Pinterest\n    *   Tumblr\n    *   LinkedIn (less likely for adolescents, but depends on review scope)\n\n*   **Related Concepts/Behaviors:**\n    *   Cyberbullying\n    *   Online harassment\n    *   Social comparison\n    *   FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\n    *   Internet addiction\n    *   Social media addiction\n    *   Problematic internet use\n    *   Problematic social media use\n    *   Digital engagement\n    *   Online identity\n    *   Influencer culture\n    *   Algorithmic feed\n    *   \u0022doomscrolling\u0022 (emerging term, might not be in subject headings yet)\n\n---\n\n#### B. Adolescents (Target Population)\n\n*   **Core Terms:**\n    *   Adolescent* (use truncation \u0060*\u0060 for adolescent, adolescents)\n    *   Teenager* (teenager, teenagers, teens)\n    *   Youth\n    *   Young person* (young person, young people)\n    *   Juvenile* (less common for mental health, but sometimes used)\n\n*   **Age Ranges (useful for filtering or specific searches):**\n    *   \u0022aged 10-19\u0022\n    *   \u0022aged 12-18\u0022\n    *   \u0022young adult*\u0022 (be careful, this often extends into early 20s, so might need to be combined with age filters)\n    *   \u0022student*\u0022 (can be too broad, but useful in some contexts)\n    *   \u0022high school\u0022\n    *   \u0022middle school\u0022\n\n---\n\n#### C. Mental Health (and specific conditions/indicators)\n\n*   **Core Terms (general):**\n    *   Mental health\n    *   Well-being (or wellbeing)\n    *   Psychological well-being\n    *   Emotional health\n    *   Psychological distress\n    *   Mental illness\n    *   Mental disorder\n    *   Psychopathology\n    *   Behavioral health\n\n*   **Specific Conditions/Symptoms (negative impacts):**\n    *   Depression (or depressive symptom*, major depressive disorder)\n    *   Anxiety (or anxious symptom*, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety)\n    *   Stress\n    *   Loneliness\n    *   Social isolation\n    *   Self-esteem (or low self-esteem)\n    *   Body image (or body dissatisfaction, body dysmorphia)\n    *   Eating disorder* (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder)\n    *   Sleep disorder* (insomnia, sleep quality, sleep disturbance)\n    *   Suicide (or suicidal ideation, self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury)\n    *   Substance use (or addiction, problematic substance use)\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (less direct, but social media can impact focus)\n    *   Conduct disorder*\n    *   Aggression (or aggressive behavior)\n    *   Psychotic symptom*\n\n*   **Positive Indicators (if your review considers both sides):**\n    *   Resilience\n    *   Coping strateg*\n    *   Social support\n    *   Belonging\n\n---\n\n#### D. Impact/Relationship Terms\n\n*   **General Terms:**\n    *   Impact* (impact, impacts, impacting, impacted)\n    *   Effect* (effect, effects, affecting)\n    *   Influence* (influence, influences, influencing)\n    *   Consequence*\n    *   Outcome*\n    *   Association*\n    *   Relationship*\n    *   Correlation*\n    *   Link*\n    *   Connection*\n    *   Contribute*\n    *   Exacerbate*\n    *   Mitigate* (if looking at protective factors)\n    *   Predictor*\n    *   Determinant*\n\n*   **Directional Terms (if focusing on positive or negative specifically):**\n    *   Harm* (harm, harmful)\n    *   Detrimental\n    *   Negative\n    *   Positive\n    *   Beneficial\n    *   Risk factor*\n    *   Protective factor*\n\n---\n\n### 2) How to Combine Terms for Effective Searching\n\nNow that you have your lists, the key is using **Boolean operators** (AND, OR, NOT) and **truncation** (\u0060*\u0060) effectively.\n\n*   **OR:** Use to combine synonyms within a concept. (e.g., \u0060(adolescent* OR teenager* OR youth)\u0060) \u2013 this broadens your search.\n*   **AND:** Use to combine different concepts. (e.g., \u0060(social media) AND (adolescent*)\u0060) \u2013 this narrows your search to articles that contain terms from *all* specified concepts.\n*   **NOT:** Use to exclude irrelevant terms (use with caution, as it can exclude relevant articles). (e.g., \u0060(social media) NOT (adults)\u0060 if your database doesn\u0027t allow age filtering).\n*   **Truncation (\u0060*\u0060):** Finds variations of a word (e.g., \u0060adolescent*\u0060 finds \u0022adolescent,\u0022 \u0022adolescents,\u0022 \u0022adolescence\u0022).\n*   **Phrase Searching (\u0060\u0022 \u0022\u0060):** Use for exact phrases (e.g., \u0060\u0022mental health\u0022\u0060, \u0060\u0022social media addiction\u0022\u0060).\n\n---\n\n#### Example Search Strings (building complexity)\n\n**Step 1: Simple \u0026 Broad**\n\u0060\u0022social media\u0022 AND adolescent* AND \u0022mental health\u0022\u0060\n\n**Step 2: Adding Synonyms (within each concept using OR)**\n\u0060(social media OR \u0022social networking\u0022 OR Instagram OR TikTok OR Snapchat OR \u0022screen time\u0022) AND (adolescent* OR teenager* OR youth OR \u0022young people\u0022) AND (\u0022mental health\u0022 OR depression OR anxiety OR \u0022self-esteem\u0022 OR \u0022psychological distress\u0022)\u0060\n\n**Step 3: Refining with Impact Terms \u0026 Specifics**\n\u0060(social media OR \u0022social networking\u0022 OR Instagram OR TikTok OR Snapchat OR \u0022screen time\u0022 OR cyberbullying OR \u0022online harassment\u0022) AND (adolescent* OR teenager* OR youth OR \u0022young people\u0022 OR \u0022aged 10-19\u0022) AND (\u0022mental health\u0022 OR \u0022psychological well-being\u0022 OR depression OR anxiety OR loneliness OR \u0022body image\u0022 OR \u0022eating disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022suicidal ideation\u0022 OR \u0022self-harm\u0022 OR \u0022sleep disturbance\u0022) AND (impact* OR effect* OR influence* OR \u0022risk factor*\u0022)\u0060\n\n**Step 4: Considering positive/negative if needed**\nIf you want to focus on *negative* impacts:\n\u0060(social media OR \u0022social networking\u0022 OR Instagram OR TikTok OR Snapchat OR \u0022screen time\u0022 OR cyberbullying OR \u0022online harassment\u0022) AND (adolescent* OR teenager* OR youth OR \u0022young people\u0022 OR \u0022aged 10-19\u0022) AND (\u0022mental health\u0022 OR \u0022psychological distress\u0022 OR depression OR anxiety OR loneliness OR \u0022body dissatisfaction\u0022 OR \u0022eating disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022suicidal ideation\u0022 OR \u0022self-harm\u0022 OR \u0022sleep problems\u0022) AND (harm* OR detrimental OR negative OR adverse OR \u0022risk factor*\u0022 OR \u0022problematic use\u0022)\u0060\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Tips for Your Review:\n\n*   **Database Specifics:** When searching in databases like PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc., look for their specific **subject headings** (e.g., MeSH terms in PubMed, Emtree terms in Embase, Thesaurus terms in PsycINFO). These controlled vocabularies are often more powerful than just keyword searching. For example, \u0022Adolescent\u0022 might be a MeSH term, or \u0022Social Media\u0022 or \u0022Mental Health.\u0022\n*   **Iterative Process:** Your initial searches will likely yield too many or too few results. Adjust your terms \u2013 add more synonyms, remove less relevant ones, narrow/broaden age ranges, or specify platforms.\n*   **Check Reference Lists:** Once you find a highly relevant article, check its bibliography for other key papers.\n*   **Pilot Search:** Run a few of your more comprehensive strings in your target databases to see the types of results you get. This will help you refine your terms before your full systematic search.\n*   **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:** Clearly define what constitutes \u0022adolescent\u0022 (e.g., 10-19 years old) and specific mental health outcomes to guide your term selection and subsequent screening.\n\nGood luck with your review! This thoughtful approach to search term development will significantly strengthen your work."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
