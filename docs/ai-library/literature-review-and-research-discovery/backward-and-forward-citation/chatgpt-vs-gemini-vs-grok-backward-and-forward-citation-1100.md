  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Although I don\u2019t have the capability to access external databases like Web of Science or Scopus directly, I can guide you on how to perform citation chaining to find additional literature based on your key papers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide for Citation Chaining\n\n#### Backward Citation (Finding Papers Cited by Your Key Papers)\n\n1. **Access the Database:**\n   - Go to Web of Science or Scopus and log in, if necessary. Your institution may provide access, so check for any institutional login options.\n\n2. **Enter Your Key Papers:**\n   - Start by entering the details of one of your key papers in the search bar. You can search by title, author, or DOI.\n\n3. **Locate Citation Information:**\n   - Once you\u2019ve found the paper, look for options or tabs such as \u201CCited References\u201D or \u201CReferences.\u201D This section lists all the papers that the key paper has cited (backward citations).\n\n4. **Review the Cited Papers:**\n   - Go through the cited papers. Take note of the ones that are relevant to your research area. You can often see the context in which they were cited, which may help in identifying their relevance.\n\n5. **Repeat for Each Key Paper:**\n   - Repeat this process for each of your 10 key papers to build a comprehensive list of cited literature.\n\n6. **Export References (If Necessary):**\n   - Many databases allow you to export citation information directly to reference management software like EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero, making it easier to manage your references.\n\n### Tips for Effective Backward Citation Chaining\n\n- **Look for Influential Papers:** Focus on highly cited papers or seminal works that your key papers reference.\n- **Identify Themes:** As you collect these papers, try to identify common themes or trends in the literature that could be pertinent to your research.\n- **Use Boolean Operators:** If you\u0027re searching for specific topics, use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your searches in the database.\n\n### Following Up\n\n1. **Read Abstracts and Conclusions:** To quickly assess relevance, read the abstracts and conclusions of the cited papers.\n  \n2. **Document Everything:** Keep a running list with paper titles, authors, publication years, and relevant notes to help summarize why each paper might be useful.\n\n3. **Consider Forward Citation Chaining:** After identifying backward citations, you can also look at who has cited these key papers (forward citations) to find more recent research in the field.\n\nUsing this systematic approach will help you in discovering a wider array of literature that relates closely to your area of interest. If you have any specific questions about the process or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!", "Gemini": "This is an excellent strategy! Citation chaining (both backward and forward) is one of the most effective ways to build a comprehensive literature review.\n\nLet\u0027s break down how to do backward citation chaining using Web of Science and Scopus for your 10 key papers. The goal is to identify all the papers *cited by* your key papers.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding Backward Citation Chaining\n\n**Backward Citation Chaining** involves looking at the *reference list* of a key paper to find earlier, foundational, or related works that influenced it. These are the papers that the authors of your key paper deemed important enough to cite.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide: Web of Science (WoS)\n\nWeb of Science is powerful for this because it has comprehensive indexing of cited references.\n\n1.  **Access Web of Science:** Go to your institution\u0027s Web of Science portal (or directly to webofscience.com if you have a personal subscription). You\u0027ll likely need to log in.\n\n2.  **Search for One of Your Key Papers:**\n    *   Use the \u0022Documents\u0022 search.\n    *   The most precise way is to search by **Title** (put the full title in quotation marks for an exact phrase search).\n    *   Alternatively, use the **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier) if you have it \u2013 this is often the fastest and most accurate.\n    *   You can also search by **Author** and **Year** to narrow it down if the title is common.\n\n3.  **Go to the Paper\u0027s Record:**\n    *   Once you find your key paper in the search results, click on its title to open the full record page.\n\n4.  **Locate \u0022Cited References\u0022:**\n    *   On the paper\u0027s record page, scroll down. You will see a section titled **\u0022Cited References\u0022**. This lists all the papers that *this key paper* has cited.\n    *   There will usually be a number indicating how many references there are (e.g., \u0022Cited References (56)\u0022).\n\n5.  **View and Export the Cited References:**\n    *   Click on the **number** next to \u0022Cited References\u0022 or a button that says \u0022View all X References.\u0022\n    *   This will open a **new search results page** displaying all the papers cited by your key paper as a list of WoS records.\n    *   **Review and Refine (Optional but Recommended):**\n        *   Scan the titles of these cited papers. Are there any obvious outliers?\n        *   You can use the filters on the left-hand side (e.g., \u0022Publication Year,\u0022 \u0022Research Area,\u0022 \u0022Document Type\u0022 like \u0022Review Article\u0022) to further narrow down this list if it\u0027s very large, but for initial chaining, it\u0027s good to keep it broad.\n    *   **Export:**\n        *   Select all the relevant papers (or use the \u0022Select All\u0022 option).\n        *   Click the **\u0022Export\u0022** button (usually near the top right).\n        *   Choose your preferred format (e.g., \u0022Plain Text,\u0022 \u0022Excel,\u0022 \u0022RIS file\u0022 for citation managers). For simple review, \u0022Excel\u0022 or \u0022Plain Text\u0022 is often easiest. Make sure to export relevant fields like Author, Title, Year, Journal.\n        *   Save this file, clearly labeling it (e.g., \u0022Cited_References_KeyPaper1_WoS\u0022).\n\n6.  **Repeat for All 10 Key Papers:**\n    *   Go back and perform steps 2-5 for each of your other 9 key papers.\n    *   Save each set of cited references separately.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide: Scopus\n\nScopus offers a similar and equally effective process for backward chaining.\n\n1.  **Access Scopus:** Go to your institution\u0027s Scopus portal (or directly to scopus.com if you have a personal subscription). Log in if required.\n\n2.  **Search for One of Your Key Papers:**\n    *   Use the \u0022Documents\u0022 search.\n    *   Again, searching by **Title** (with quotation marks) or **DOI** is the most accurate.\n\n3.  **Go to the Paper\u0027s Record:**\n    *   Click on the title of your key paper in the search results to open its full document details page.\n\n4.  **Locate \u0022References\u0022:**\n    *   On the paper\u0027s document details page, scroll down. You will find a section simply titled **\u0022References.\u0022**\n    *   Like WoS, there will be a number indicating the count (e.g., \u002250 References\u0022).\n\n5.  **View and Export the References:**\n    *   Click on the **number** next to \u0022References.\u0022\n    *   This will display all the papers cited by your key paper as a list.\n    *   **Review and Refine (Optional):** Similar to WoS, you can quickly scan for relevance. Scopus also provides filters on the left-hand side.\n    *   **Export:**\n        *   Select the papers you want to export (or select all).\n        *   Click the **\u0022Export\u0022** button (usually at the top of the results list).\n        *   Choose your desired format (e.g., \u0022CSV\u0022 for Excel, \u0022RIS\u0022 for citation managers). Select the fields you need (Author, Title, Year, Source, DOI, etc.).\n        *   Save this file, clearly labeling it (e.g., \u0022References_KeyPaper1_Scopus\u0022).\n\n6.  **Repeat for All 10 Key Papers:**\n    *   Go back and perform steps 2-5 for each of your other 9 key papers.\n    *   Save each set of references separately.\n\n---\n\n### Post-Processing and Organization\n\nOnce you have exported the cited references for all 10 of your key papers from either WoS or Scopus (or both):\n\n1.  **Combine All Lists:** Open all your exported files (e.g., in Excel) and copy-paste them into one single master spreadsheet.\n2.  **De-duplicate:** This is **CRUCIAL**. Many of your key papers will cite the same foundational works.\n    *   Use Excel\u0027s \u0022Remove Duplicates\u0022 feature (Data tab \u003E Data Tools group \u003E Remove Duplicates). Select the columns that uniquely identify a paper (e.g., Title, Author, Year, DOI).\n    *   Alternatively, if you exported to an RIS file, you can import them all into a citation manager like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote, which have built-in de-duplication functions.\n3.  **Sort and Filter:**\n    *   Sort the remaining unique papers by **Citation Count** (if available in your export \u2013 WoS and Scopus records usually include this). This can highlight highly influential works.\n    *   Sort by **Publication Year** to see the chronological development of ideas.\n    *   Filter by **Document Type** (e.g., prioritize \u0022Review Articles\u0022 if you find them, as they are often excellent starting points for further reading).\n4.  **Review for Relevance:** Go through the de-duplicated list. Read the titles and abstracts of the most promising papers. Mark them as \u0022To Read,\u0022 \u0022Relevant,\u0022 \u0022Less Relevant,\u0022 etc.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed process will provide you with a robust list of foundational and related literature that your 10 key papers are built upon. This is an excellent foundation for your literature review!", "Grok": "### Step-by-Step Guide to Backward Citation Chaining Using Web of Science or Scopus\n\nCitation chaining is a powerful technique for expanding your literature search. Backward chaining involves identifying papers that your 10 key papers cite (i.e., their references), which often point to foundational or related works. Both Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus are excellent for this, as they provide comprehensive citation data, abstracts, and full reference lists. If you don\u0027t have institutional access, check if your university/library provides it, or consider free alternatives like Google Scholar (though it\u0027s less structured for chaining).\n\nI\u0027ll outline how to do this in each database. You\u0027ll need the DOIs, titles, or author names of your 10 key papers to start. (If you share them, I can help refine searches, but I\u0027ll keep this general.)\n\n#### 1. Using Web of Science (WoS)\nWoS is strong for citation analysis across sciences and social sciences. It\u0027s indexed deeply for references.\n\n- **Access WoS**: Go to [clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science](https://clarivate.com/web-of-sciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science) (requires subscription/login via your institution).\n  \n- **Search for Your Key Papers**:\n  1. In the search bar, select \u0022Basic Search.\u0022\n  2. Enter details of one key paper at a time (e.g., title: \u0022exact title\u0022 OR DOI: \u002210.xxxx/xxxx\u0022). Use quotes for precision.\n  3. Refine by year, author, or journal if needed (e.g., add \u0060PY = 2020\u0060 for publication year).\n  4. Hit search\u2014results should show the paper if indexed (most recent lit is covered).\n\n- **Access Backward Citations (Cited References)**:\n  1. Click on the paper\u0027s title in results to open its full record.\n  2. Scroll to the \u0022Cited References\u0022 section (usually below the abstract). This lists all papers cited by your key paper\u2014often 20\u2013100\u002B entries.\n  3. Click \u0022View full record\u0022 or \u0022Export\u0022 for each cited reference to see details (title, authors, journal, year).\n  4. To chain efficiently: Use the \u0022Times Cited\u0022 count to prioritize highly influential cited works (e.g., those cited 100\u002B times).\n\n- **Batch Process for All 10 Papers**:\n  1. From the initial search, mark/select all 10 papers (or search them in one query using OR operators, e.g., \u0060TI = (title1 OR title2 OR ...)\u0060).\n  2. Export the list (choose \u0022Cited References\u0022 in export options) to download a file with all backward citations in CSV/Excel format.\n  3. In the exported file, sort by year or citation count to identify seminal works. Use WoS\u0027s \u0022Analyze Results\u0022 tool to spot common themes/authors across your papers.\n\n- **Tips**:\n  - WoS covers ~1900\u2013present; for older refs, it pulls from historical indexes.\n  - If a paper isn\u0027t found, try the \u0022Cited Reference Search\u0022 tab: Enter incomplete citation details (e.g., author \u002B year) to locate it.\n  - Total time: 15\u201330 min per paper if manual; faster with export.\n\n#### 2. Using Scopus\nScopus (from Elsevier) is user-friendly for interdisciplinary searches and includes more conference papers than WoS.\n\n- **Access Scopus**: Visit [scopus.com](https://www.scopus.com) (subscription via institution required).\n\n- **Search for Your Key Papers**:\n  1. Use the main search bar in \u0022Document Search\u0022 mode.\n  2. Input paper details (e.g., \u0060TITLE-ABS-KEY(\u0022exact title\u0022)\u0060 or \u0060DOI(10.xxxx/xxxx)\u0060). Combine with AND for authors/years.\n  3. Filter results by \u0022Article\u0022 or \u0022Review\u0022 type, date range, etc.\n  4. Click the paper\u0027s title to view the full record.\n\n- **Access Backward Citations (References)**:\n  1. In the paper\u0027s detail view, look for the \u0022References\u0022 tab or section (right sidebar or below abstract).\n  2. It displays a list of all cited works with hyperlinks to their Scopus records (if indexed).\n  3. Click individual references to explore further, or use the \u0022View all\u0022 option for the full bibliography.\n  4. Check citation metrics like \u0022Cited by\u0022 to gauge relevance.\n\n- **Batch Process for All 10 Papers**:\n  1. Search for multiple papers using Boolean operators (e.g., \u0060TITLE(\u0022title1\u0022 OR \u0022title2\u0022 OR ...)\u0060).\n  2. Select all results, then click \u0022Export\u0022 and choose \u0022References\u0022 to get a file with all backward citations.\n  3. In the export (RIS or CSV format), filter for duplicates or high-impact cites. Import into tools like EndNote/Zotero for deduplication and further chaining.\n\n- **Tips**:\n  - Scopus spans 1788\u2013present but excels in post-1996 coverage.\n  - Use the \u0022Cited by\u0022 panel for forward chaining later (papers citing your keys).\n  - If refs aren\u0027t hyperlinked, copy-paste them into a new Scopus search.\n  - Time estimate: 10\u201320 min per paper; exports speed it up.\n\n#### Next Steps After Collecting Backward Citations\n- **Review and Select**: Skim abstracts/titles of the cited papers (access via database or PubMed/Google Scholar). Prioritize those frequently cited across your 10 keys\u2014these are likely \u0022must-reads.\u0022\n- **Avoid Duplicates**: Use reference manager software (e.g., Zotero, free) to organize ~200\u2013500 new refs from 10 papers.\n- **Expand the Chain**: Once you have promising backward finds, repeat the process on those for deeper chaining.\n- **Limitations**: Not all citations are indexed (e.g., books/chapters); supplement with Google Scholar\u0027s \u0022Cited by\u0022 for broader reach.\n- **Efficiency Hack**: If your field is specific (e.g., AI, biology), share more details for tailored search strings.\n\nThis should net you 100\u002B relevant papers quickly. If you run into access issues or need help with a sample search, provide more info! For forward chaining (papers citing your keys), let me know\u2014we can cover that next."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
