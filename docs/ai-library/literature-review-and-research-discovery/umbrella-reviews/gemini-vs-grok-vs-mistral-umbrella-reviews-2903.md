  :responses='{"Gemini": "An umbrella review (review of reviews) on dietary interventions for cardiovascular disease is a fantastic and much-needed undertaking! It will provide a high-level synthesis of existing evidence.\n\nHere\u0027s a comprehensive guide to help you search for existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses on your topic:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Deconstruct Your Research Question \u0026 Identify Key Concepts\n\nBefore you start searching, break down your topic into its core components. This will help you identify appropriate keywords and controlled vocabulary terms.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Study Design:** Systematic Review OR Meta-analysis (crucial for an umbrella review)\n2.  **Intervention:** Dietary Interventions (e.g., specific diets, food groups, nutrients, supplements)\n3.  **Outcome/Population:** Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) or its risk factors/precursors\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify Relevant Databases\n\nYou\u0027ll need to search multiple databases to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n**Primary Databases (Essential):**\n\n*   **PubMed / MEDLINE:** Excellent for biomedical literature, uses MeSH (Medical Subject Headings).\n*   **Embase:** Broader coverage than PubMed, especially for European literature, pharmaceuticals, and conference abstracts. Uses Emtree.\n*   **Cochrane Library:** Specifically focuses on systematic reviews of healthcare interventions. Crucial for SRs/MAs.\n    *   **Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR):** Contains full Cochrane Reviews.\n    *   **CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials):** While primarily for RCTs, it can sometimes point to included studies within reviews, or review protocols.\n*   **Web of Science (Core Collection):** Interdisciplinary, good for citation tracking and finding highly cited reviews.\n*   **Scopus:** Similar to Web of Science, very broad, good for citation tracking.\n\n**Secondary / Complementary Databases (Consider based on initial results and scope):**\n\n*   **Google Scholar:** Useful for identifying reviews not indexed in traditional databases, \u0022grey literature,\u0022 or reviews from less conventional publishers. Be prepared for a lot of noise.\n*   **PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews):** Crucial for finding *registered protocols* of systematic reviews. This helps identify ongoing reviews and avoid duplication. While it won\u0027t give you published reviews, it\u0027s good to check for reviews that *will be* published soon.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Develop Your Keyword Strategy\n\nFor each core concept, brainstorm a wide range of keywords, including synonyms, broader terms, narrower terms, and controlled vocabulary (MeSH for PubMed, Emtree for Embase).\n\n### Concept 1: Study Design (Systematic Review / Meta-analysis)\n\nThis is the most critical filter for an umbrella review.\n\n*   **Free-text keywords:**\n    *   \u0022systematic review*\u0022 (truncation \u0060*\u0060 covers \u0022review\u0022, \u0022reviews\u0022, \u0022reviewer\u0022)\n    *   \u0022meta-analys*\u0022 (covers \u0022analysis\u0022, \u0022analyses\u0022)\n    *   \u0022review of reviews\u0022\n    *   \u0022overview of reviews\u0022\n    *   \u0022umbrella review\u0022 (might find other umbrella reviews, good for cross-referencing)\n    *   \u0022evidence synthesis\u0022 (broader, might capture some but less precise)\n*   **Controlled Vocabulary (e.g., MeSH in PubMed):**\n    *   \u0022Systematic Review\u0022 [Publication Type]\n    *   \u0022Meta-Analysis\u0022 [Publication Type]\n\n### Concept 2: Dietary Interventions\n\nThis needs to be broad initially to capture all relevant types, then you can refine.\n\n*   **General terms:**\n

Practical Search Strategy Steps\n\n1.  **Start Broad, Then Refine:** Begin with a comprehensive set of keywords. It\u0027s better to capture too much initially and filter later than to miss relevant reviews.\n2.  **Translate for Each Database:** The exact syntax (e.g., proximity operators like \u0060NEAR\u0060, field codes like \u0060[tiab]\u0060) will differ for each database. Consult their help guides.\n3.  **Use Filters/Limits:**\n    *   **Publication Type:** Most databases allow you to filter by \u0022Systematic Review\u0022 or \u0022Meta-Analysis.\u0022 Use this *in addition* to your keyword strategy for robustness.\n    *   **Language:** Typically \u0022English\u0022 for most umbrella reviews, but be aware of this limitation.\n    *   **Date:** Consider if you want to limit to recent reviews (e.g., last 10 years), or include all reviews. For an umbrella review, including all relevant SRs/MAs, regardless of publication date, is often preferred, but you might later choose to analyze by publication date.\n4.  **Run Pilot Searches:** Test your search strings in one or two databases to see the volume of results and the relevance. Adjust your keywords if you\u0027re getting too many irrelevant hits or missing obvious ones.\n5.  **Save Your Searches:** Most databases allow you to save your search strategy and alerts for new publications. This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.\n6.  **Export Results:** Export all your search results (including full citation details and abstracts) into a reference management software (e.g., EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley).\n7.  **Deduplicate:** Remove duplicate records across databases using your reference management software.\n8.  **Screening:**\n    *   **Title/Abstract Screening:** Two independent reviewers should screen titles and abstracts against your pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n    *   **Full-Text Screening:** Retrieve the full text of potentially relevant reviews and have two independent reviewers assess them against your criteria.\n9.  **Citation Chasing / Snowballing:**\n    *   **Backward Citation Chasing:** Examine the reference lists of all included systematic reviews to identify any other relevant SRs/MAs that your initial search might have missed.\n    *   **Forward Citation Chasing:** Use tools like Web of Science or Scopus to see which newer articles have cited your included systematic reviews. This can uncover more recent SRs/MAs on the same topic.\n10. **Document Everything:** Meticulously record every step of your search strategy, including database names, search terms, filters applied, dates of search, and number of results. This is essential for the PRISMA flow diagram and the methods section of your umbrella review.\n11. **Register Your Protocol:** Register your umbrella review protocol in PROSPERO. This enhances transparency and reduces the risk of duplication.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you\u0027ll be well-equipped to conduct a thorough and systematic search for existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses on dietary interventions for cardiovascular disease. Good luck!", "Grok": "### Step-by-Step Guide to Searching for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n\nConducting an umbrella review requires identifying high-quality overviews of existing systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on dietary interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Focus on databases that index SRs/MAs, such as those with methodological filters. I\u0027ll outline how to search effectively, provide example search strategies, and suggest starting points based on established methods in evidence synthesis (e.g., from Cochrane or PRISMA guidelines). Since I can\u0027t perform real-time searches, these are based on standard protocols and known literature up to my last training data (2023). You should verify and update via academic databases.\n\n#### 1. **Key Databases to Search**\nPrioritize these for SRs/MAs on nutrition and CVD:\n- **PubMed/MEDLINE**: Free, excellent for medical literature. Use filters for \u0022Systematic Review\u0022 or \u0022Meta-Analysis.\u0022\n- **Embase**: Comprehensive for biomedical topics; includes more European/international studies.\n- **Cochrane Library**: Gold standard for SRs; search the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) specifically.\n- **Web of Science or Scopus**: For broader citation tracking and identifying reviews.\n- **PROSPERO**: Register of ongoing SRs to check for duplicates or gaps.\n- **Epistemonikos or PDQ Evidence**: Specialized databases for SRs/MAs, great for overviews.\n- Gray literature: Google Scholar, OpenGrey, or WHO databases for unpublished reviews.\n\nAim for a date range (e.g., 2010\u2013present) to capture recent evidence, and include terms for CVD outcomes like coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, or heart failure.\n\n#### 2. **Developing Your Search Strategy**\nBuild a sensitive search using Boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT), MeSH terms (for PubMed), and free-text keywords. Focus on three concepts: **Dietary interventions**, **CVD**, and **SR/MA types**.\n\n- **Example Search Strings** (adapt for each database; test iteratively):\n  - **PubMed**:\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    (\u0022Diet\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Diet Therapy\u0022[Mesh] OR diet* OR nutrition* OR \u0022Mediterranean diet\u0022 OR \u0022DASH diet\u0022 OR \u0022low-carb*\u0022 OR \u0022plant-based\u0022 OR vegetarian OR vegan OR \u0022sodium reduction\u0022 OR \u0022fiber intake\u0022 OR \u0022omega-3\u0022 OR \u0022polyunsaturated fatty acid*\u0022) \n    AND \n    (\u0022Cardiovascular Diseases\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Heart Diseases\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Myocardial Infarction\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Stroke\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Hypertension\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Atherosclerosis\u0022[Mesh] OR cardiovascular OR heart disease* OR CVD OR coronary OR stroke OR hypertens*) \n    AND \n    (\u0022Systematic Review\u0022 OR \u0022Meta-Analysis\u0022[Mesh] OR meta-analys* OR overview OR \u0022review of reviews\u0022 OR umbrella review)\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    - Filters: Article types = Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis; Humans; English language.\n    - Expected yield: ~500\u20131,000 hits (deduplicate later).\n\n  - **Cochrane Library** (simpler interface):\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    (diet OR nutrition OR Mediterranean OR DASH OR low-carb OR plant-based) AND (cardiovascular OR heart OR CVD OR coronary OR stroke) in Title, Abstract, or Keywords; Limit to Reviews.\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n  - **Embase** (uses Emtree terms):\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n    (\u0027diet\u0027/exp OR \u0027diet therapy\u0027/exp OR diet*:ti,ab OR nutrition*:ti,ab) AND (\u0027cardiovascular disease\u0027/exp OR \u0027heart disease\u0027/exp OR \u0027cerebrovascular accident\u0027/exp OR cardiovasc*:ti,ab OR heart:ti,ab) AND (\u0027systematic review\u0027/exp OR \u0027meta analysis\u0027/exp OR meta-analys*:ti,ab OR \u0027review of reviews\u0027:ti,ab)\n    \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n- **Tips**:\n  - Include specific diets (e.g., Mediterranean, DASH, ketogenic) and nutrients (e.g., saturated fats, fruits/vegetables) to broaden.\n  - Exclude non-relevant terms: NOT (animal OR in vitro) to focus on human studies.\n  - Use tools like Polyglot (for multi-database translation) or Rayyan for screening.\n  - For umbrella review specificity, add \u0022overview\u0022 OR \u0022umbrella\u0022 to prioritize second-level reviews.\n\n#### 3. **Existing Reviews to Start With (Based on Known Literature)**\nFrom established sources up to 2023, here are prominent SRs/MAs and overviews on dietary interventions for CVD.

(2016, *Journal of the American Heart Association*) \u2013 MA of 8 studies; 25% lower CVD incidence.\n  - **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Abdelhamid et al. (Cochrane, 2020) \u2013 Limited evidence for primary prevention but benefits in secondary CVD.\n  - **Sodium Reduction**: Filippini et al. (2021, *Hypertension*) \u2013 MA confirming 2\u20134 mmHg BP drop, reducing CVD events.\n  - **Low-Carb vs. Low-Fat**: Kirkpatrick et al. (2019, *Circulation*) \u2013 SR/MA; short-term benefits for low-carb, but long-term CVD neutrality.\n\nThese are from high-impact sources (e.g., Cochrane, AHA journals). GRADE assessments often rate evidence as moderate-to-high for diets like Mediterranean/DASH.\n\n#### 4. **Next Steps for Your Umbrella Review**\n- **Screening**: Use PRISMA-ScR (for scoping) or PRISMA (for full) flow diagram. Assess quality with AMSTAR-2 tool for included SRs/MAs.\n- **Data Extraction**: Focus on effect sizes (e.g., RR for CVD events), heterogeneity, and overlaps (e.g., via CINeMA for confidence in evidence).\n- **Gaps**: Current literature emphasizes whole-diet patterns over single nutrients; look for emerging areas like intermittent fasting or personalized nutrition.\n- **Tools**: EndNote/Zotero for management; RevMan for meta-meta-analysis if needed.\n- **Consult Experts**: Register on PROSPERO; collaborate with a librarian for refined searches.\n\nThis should yield 50\u2013200 relevant SRs/MAs. If you provide more details (e.g., specific diets or CVD subtypes), I can refine the strategy further. Always critically appraise sources for bias.", "Mistral": "Conducting an umbrella review on dietary interventions for cardiovascular disease involves systematically identifying and synthesizing existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you search for these reviews:\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Research Question\nClearly define your research question. For example:\n- \u0022What are the effects of dietary interventions on cardiovascular disease outcomes?\u0022\n- \u0022Which dietary interventions are most effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease?\u0022\n\n### Step 2: Develop a Search Strategy\nCreate a comprehensive search strategy that includes relevant keywords, MeSH terms, and Boolean operators. Here are some key terms you might consider:\n- Dietary interventions\n- Nutrition\n- Diet\n- Cardiovascular disease\n- Heart disease\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Stroke\n- Hypertension\n- Systematic review\n- Meta-analysis\n\n### Step 3: Select Databases\nIdentify the databases you will search. Common databases for systematic reviews and meta-analyses include:\n- PubMed/MEDLINE\n- Embase\n- Cochrane Library\n- Web of Science\n- Scopus\n- CINAHL\n- PsycINFO\n\n### Step 4: Conduct the Search\nUse your search strategy to conduct searches in the selected databases. Here\u2019s an example of a search string for PubMed:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n(\u0022dietary interventions\u0022 OR \u0022nutrition\u0022 OR \u0022diet\u0022) AND (\u0022cardiovascular disease\u0022 OR \u0022heart disease\u0022 OR \u0022coronary artery disease\u0022 OR \u0022stroke\u0022 OR \u0022hypertension\u0022) AND (\u0022systematic review\u0022 OR \u0022meta-analysis\u0022)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Step 5: Screen and Select Studies\n1. **Title and Abstract Screening**: Review the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to identify potentially relevant reviews.\n2. **Full-Text Screening**: Obtain the full texts of the potentially relevant reviews and assess them against your inclusion criteria.\n\n### Step 6: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nDefine your inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example:\n- **Inclusion Criteria**:\n  - Systematic reviews or meta-analyses\n  - Focus on dietary interventions\n  - Outcomes related to cardiovascular disease\n  - Published in peer-reviewed journals\n- **Exclusion Criteria**:\n  - Non-systematic reviews\n  - Non-dietary interventions\n  - Non-cardiovascular outcomes\n  - Non-peer-reviewed articles\n\n### Step 7: Data Extraction\nExtract relevant data from the included reviews. This may include:\n- Study characteristics (e.g., authors, publication year, type of review)\n- Population characteristics (e.g., age, gender, health status)\n- Intervention details (e.g., type of dietary intervention, duration)\n- Outcomes measured (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol levels, cardiovascular events)\n- Results and conclusions\n\n### Step 8: Quality Assessment\nAssess the quality of the included reviews using a validated tool such as AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) or ROBIS (Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews).\n\n### Step 9: Synthesize the Findings\nSynthesize the findings from the included reviews. This may involve:\n- Narrative synthesis\n- Tabulation of results\n- Meta-analysis of meta-analyses (if appropriate)\n\n### Step 10: Report the Findings\nWrite a comprehensive report or manuscript detailing your methods, findings, and conclusions. Ensure that your report adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.\n\n### Example Search Strategy for PubMed\nHere\u2019s a more detailed example of a search strategy for PubMed:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n#1 (\u0022dietary interventions\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022nutrition\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022diet\u0022[Title/Abstract])\n#2 (\u0022cardiovascular disease\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022heart disease\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022coronary artery disease\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022stroke\u0022[Title/Abstract] OR \u0022hypertension\u0022[Title/Abstract])\n#3 (\u0022systematic review\u0022[Publication Type] OR \u0022meta-analysis\u0022[Publication Type])\n#4 #1 AND #2 AND #3\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Use Filters**: Many databases offer filters to limit your search to systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n- **Reference Lists**: Check the reference lists of included reviews for additional relevant studies.\n- **Grey Literature**: Consider searching for grey literature, such as conference abstracts and unpublished studies.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to conduct a thorough and systematic search for existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses on dietary interventions for cardiovascular disease."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
