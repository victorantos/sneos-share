  :responses='{"DeepSeek": "\u003Cthink\u003E\nOkay, so I need to help someone with their systematic literature review on mindfulness-based interventions for anxiety in college students. Let me start by breaking down each of their four requests. \n\nFirst, the search strategy for PubMed and PsycINFO. I remember that systematic reviews require comprehensive searches, so I should think about the key concepts: mindfulness-based interventions, anxiety, and college students. For each database, I\u0027ll need to use controlled vocabulary like MeSH terms for PubMed and maybe the Thesaurus terms for PsycINFO. Also, including synonyms and related terms is important. Maybe use Boolean operators to combine these terms. For example, \u0022mindfulness\u0022 could have terms like MBCT, MBSR, or \u0022mindfulness-based stress reduction\u0022. Anxiety terms might include \u0022anxiety disorders\u0022, \u0022generalized anxiety disorder\u0022, etc. College students could be \u0022students\u0022, \u0022university\u0022, \u0022undergraduate\u0022, etc. Also, setting limits like publication date (last 10 years?), language (English?), and age group (young adults?).\n\nNext, inclusion and exclusion criteria. They need to define what studies they include. Population: college students with anxiety. Maybe include both diagnosed and non-diagnosed? Intervention: mindfulness-based interventions, like MBSR, MBCT, or other structured programs. Comparison could be active controls, waitlist, or no treatment. Outcomes: anxiety measures, validated scales. Study designs: RCTs, maybe quasi-experimental? Exclude non-peer-reviewed, non-English, other populations (like high school or adults not in college), interventions that are not mindfulness-based (like other therapies), studies without control groups, or those not measuring anxiety as a primary outcome.\n\nData extraction form. This should capture study details, population characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, results. So fields like author, year, country, study design, sample size, age, gender, inclusion/exclusion criteria, intervention type, duration, control group type, outcome measures, time points, main findings, limitations, funding source. Maybe also adverse events if any.\n\nQuality assessment tools. PRISMA is for reporting guidelines, but they might need to mention they followed PRISMA. For risk of bias, Cochrane RoB 2.0 for RCTs. If there are non-randomized studies, maybe ROBINS-I. Also, maybe check for other quality aspects like CONSORT for reporting of trials. Maybe mention using tools like GRADE for assessing evidence quality, but Cochrane RoB is more about study methodology.\n\nWait, the user mentioned PRISMA and Cochrane Risk of Bias. So PRISMA is a guideline for conducting and reporting systematic reviews, so they should follow the PRISMA checklist. The flow diagram is part of that. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool is for assessing the methodological quality of included studies, specifically RCTs. So for each study, they\u0027ll assess domains like randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective reporting, other biases.\n\nLet me make sure I cover all parts. For the search strategy, example terms for each database. For inclusion/exclusion, clear criteria. Data extraction form with all necessary fields. Quality assessment using Cochrane RoB 2.0 and mention PRISMA for reporting.\n\nI should also think about possible filters. For example, in PubMed, using the Clinical Queries filter for therapy or systematic reviews. But since they\u0027re looking for original studies, maybe not. Also, check if they want only RCTs or other designs. The inclusion criteria should specify that. Maybe include RCTs and quasi-experimental if they allow it.\n\nAnother thing: when developing the search strategy, using truncation and wildcards for terms. Like \u0022student*\u0022 to capture student, students, etc. Also, combining terms with OR within each concept and then AND between concepts. For example, (mindfulness terms) AND (anxiety terms) AND (college student terms). Testing the search strategy for sensitivity and specificity might be needed, but maybe that\u0027s beyond the scope here.\n\nInclusion criteria should have time frame? Maybe last 10 years unless they want all available. Also, language restrictions. Exclusion might include non-English studies, but that\u0027s a limitation. They need to justify that.\n\nData extraction form should be pilot-tested. Maybe include a field for notes or comments. Also, key outcomes like mean differences, effect sizes, p-values, confidence intervals. Maybe whether the study found a significant reduction in anxiety.\n\nQuality assessment: Cochrane RoB 2.0 has specific questions for each domain. Each study is rated as low risk, some concerns, or high risk. They can summarize this in a table.\n\nI think that\u0027s the main points. Now, structure each part step by step, making sure each of the four sections is addressed clearly with examples where possible.\n\u003C/think\u003E\n\n### 1. **Comprehensive Search Strategy**

Randomization process  \n  2. Deviations from intended interventions  \n  3. Missing outcome data  \n  4. Outcome measurement  \n  5. Selective reporting  \n ", "Grok": "Below is a structured response to your query for conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for anxiety in college students. I\u0027ll address each of your four requests step by step, drawing on standard SLR methodologies (e.g., from the PRISMA guidelines and Cochrane Handbook). This is tailored to your topic, but you may need to refine it based on your specific research question (e.g., \u0022What is the effectiveness of MBIs in reducing anxiety symptoms among college students?\u0022).\n\n### 1. Comprehensive Search Strategy for PubMed and PsycINFO\nA robust search strategy should use a combination of keywords, MeSH terms (for PubMed), and subject headings (for PsycINFO), along with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). Focus on three key concepts: **Mindfulness-based interventions**, **Anxiety**, and **College students**. Aim to capture variations in terminology (e.g., \u0022university students,\u0022 \u0022undergraduates\u0022).\n\n- **General Tips**: \n  - Run searches in both databases for comprehensiveness (PubMed for biomedical literature; PsycINFO for psychological/behavioral studies).\n  - Use truncation (e.g., anxi* for anxiety/anxious) and synonyms.\n  - Limit to English-language, peer-reviewed articles from the last 20\u201325 years (e.g., 2000\u2013present) unless your scope differs.\n  - Export results to a reference manager like EndNote or Zotero for deduplication.\n  - Pilot the search and iterate based on results (target 500\u20132000 initial hits).\n\n#### PubMed Search Strategy\nPubMed uses MeSH (Medical Subject Headings). Here\u0027s a sample string (copy-paste ready; adapt date filters via the interface):\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n(\u0022Mindfulness\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Meditation\u0022[Mesh] OR mindfulness* OR \u0022mindfulness-based\u0022 OR MBSR OR MBCT OR \u0022mindful* intervention*\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* therapy\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* practice*\u0022) \nAND \n(\u0022Anxiety Disorders\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Anxiety\u0022[Mesh] OR anxi* OR \u0022panic disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022generalized anxiety\u0022 OR GAD) \nAND \n(\u0022Students\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Universities\u0022[Mesh] OR college* OR universi* OR undergrad* OR postgrad* OR \u0022higher education\u0022 OR \u0022young adult*\u0022 OR \u0022emerging adult*\u0022)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n- **Expected Yield**: ~200\u2013500 results (depending on date filters).\n- **Additional Filters**: Humans (not animals); RCT, quasi-experimental, or observational studies; 2000\u20132024.\n- **Sensitivity Check**: Add terms like \u0022yoga\u0022 or \u0022tai chi\u0022 if including related mindfulness practices.\n\n#### PsycINFO Search Strategy\nPsycINFO uses its own subject headings. Sample string (via EBSCO interface):\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n(TI (mindfulness* OR \u0022mindfulness-based\u0022 OR MBSR OR MBCT OR \u0022mindful* intervention*\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* therapy\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* practice*\u0022) OR AB (mindfulness* OR \u0022mindfulness-based\u0022 OR MBSR OR MBCT OR \u0022mindful* intervention*\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* therapy\u0022 OR \u0022mindful* practice*\u0022)) \nAND \n(TI (anxi* OR \u0022anxiety disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022panic disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022generalized anxiety\u0022 OR GAD) OR AB (anxi* OR \u0022anxiety disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022panic disorder*\u0022 OR \u0022generalized anxiety\u0022 OR GAD) OR SU (\u0022Anxiety\u0022 OR \u0022Anxiety Disorders\u0022)) \nAND \n(TI (college* OR universi* OR undergrad* OR postgrad* OR \u0022higher education\u0022 OR \u0022young adult*\u0022 OR \u0022emerging adult*\u0022) OR AB (college* OR universi* OR undergrad* OR postgrad* OR \u0022higher education\u0022 OR \u0022young adult*\u0022 OR \u0022emerging adult*\u0022) OR SU (\u0022College Students\u0022 OR \u0022Universities\u0022))\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n- **Expected Yield**: ~300\u2013600 results.\n- **Additional Filters**: Peer-reviewed; methodology limited to treatment outcome, clinical trial, or quantitative study; 2000\u20132024.\n- **Expansion**: Search gray literature (e.g., Google Scholar, theses via ProQuest) and hand-search key journals like *Mindfulness* or *Journal of American College Health*. Register your protocol on PROSPERO for transparency.\n\n### 2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nThese criteria should be predefined in your protocol to minimize bias (PICO framework: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). Apply them during title/abstract screening (e.g., via Rayyan or Covidence) and full-text review.\n\n#### Inclusion Criteria\n- **Population**: College/university students (undergraduate or graduate, aged 18\u201325 typically); must include a subgroup analysis for students if a mixed sample.\n- **Intervention**: Mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., MBSR, MBCT, mindfulness meditation programs); delivered in any format (group, individual, online) and duration (\u22654 weeks).\n- **Comparison**: Any (e.g., waitlist control, active control like relaxation training, or no intervention); include uncontrolled studies if RCTs are scarce.\n- **Outcomes**: Primary: Anxiety reduction (measured by validated scales like GAD-7, STAI, or Beck Anxiety Inventory). Secondary: Related outcomes like stress, depression, or well-being.\n- **Study Design**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, cohort, or pre-post studies.\n- **Other**: Published in English; full-text available; from 2000 onward to capture modern MBIs.\n\n#### Exclusion Criteria\n- **Population**: Non-student samples (e.g., general adults, K-12 students, clinical populations without student focus).\n- **Intervention**: Non-mindfulness interventions (e.g., pure CBT without mindfulness, unrelated therapies like acupuncture); very brief (\u003C4 weeks) or non-empirical (e.g., protocols without outcomes).\n- **Outcomes**: No anxiety-related measures; only qualitative or theoretical papers.\n- **Study Design**: Case studies, reviews, commentaries, or non-empirical work (e.g., opinion pieces).\n- **Other**: Non-English; duplicates; retracted articles.\n\nAim for two independent reviewers to screen; resolve disagreements via discussion or a third reviewer. Expect 10\u201320% of initial hits to reach full-text stage.\n\n### 3. Data Extraction Form\nDesign a standardized form (e.g., in Excel, Google Sheets, or Covidence) to extract key data from included studies. This ensures consistency and facilitates synthesis (narrative or meta-analysis). Extract data in duplicate for reliability.\n\n#### Key Sections and Fields\n1. **Study Identification**:\n   - Authors, year, title, journal, DOI/PMID.\n   - Country/setting (e.g., US university).\n\n2. **Study Characteristics**:\n   - Design (e.g., RCT, pre-post).\n   - Sample size (total, completers, per group).\n   - Population details: Age (mean/SD), gender (% female), ethnicity, baseline anxiety level.\n   - Recruitment method (e.g., campus flyers).\n\n3. **Intervention Details**:\n   - Type (e.g., MBSR, app-based mindfulness).\n   - Duration (weeks/sessions), frequency (e.g., 8 weeks, 2x/week).\n   - Delivery (in-person, online), facilitator (trained instructor?).\n   - Fidelity checks (e.g., adherence monitoring).\n\n4. **Comparison Group**:\n   - Type (e.g., waitlist, TAU).\n   - Details (duration, content).\n\n5. **Outcomes**:\n   - Primary: Anxiety measure (tool, pre/post/follow-up scores, effect size e.g., Cohen\u0027s d).\n   - Secondary: Other measures, adverse events.\n   - Follow-up time (e.g., 3 months post-intervention).\n   - Statistical analysis (e.g., ITT vs. per-protocol, p-values, confidence intervals).\n\n6. **Quality/Risk Notes**:\n   - Funding source, conflicts of interest.\n   - Attrition rate (% dropout).\n\nPilot the form on 2\u20133 studies to refine it. For meta-analysis, prioritize extractable effect sizes.\n\n### 4. Quality Assessment Tools\nAssess study quality/risk of bias early in the process to inform synthesis (e.g., weight higher-quality studies more). Use tools appropriate for your designs; report in a summary table.\n\n- **PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)**:\n  - Not a quality tool per se, but use the PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram for reporting your SLR. It ensures transparency (e.g., track search yield, screening decisions, reasons for exclusions). Download the checklist from prisma-statement.org. Essential for publication.\n\n- **Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2) Tool**:\n  - Ideal for RCTs (most relevant for effectiveness studies). Assesses five domains: randomization process, deviations from intervention, missing data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Rate each as low/high/some concerns; generate an overall risk score.\n  - For non-RCTs (e.g., quasi-experimental), use the parallel tool RoB-NObS or adapt.\n  - How to Apply: Two reviewers score independently; use Review Manager (RevMan) software. Example: High risk if allocation concealment is unclear.\n\n- **Additional Suggestions**:\n  - **ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions)**: For quasi-experimental or cohort studies; compares to RCTs across 7 domains (e.g., confounding, bias in classification of interventions).\n  - **MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool)**: If including mixed-methods studies (quick for diverse designs).\n  - **GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)**: For overall evidence quality (high/moderate/low/very low) post-synthesis, focusing on inconsistency, imprecision, etc.\n  - Threshold: Exclude studies with high overall risk"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
