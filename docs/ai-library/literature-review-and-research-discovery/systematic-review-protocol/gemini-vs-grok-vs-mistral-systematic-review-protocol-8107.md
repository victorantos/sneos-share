Background and Rationale**\n\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance and/or impaired insulin secretion. Globally, T2DM represents a significant public health challenge, with its prevalence steadily rising. The disease is associated with a range of microvascular and macrovascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.\n\nCurrent management guidelines for T2DM emphasize lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and regular physical activity, alongside pharmacological interventions. Exercise is a cornerstone of T2DM management due to its numerous physiological benefits. These benefits include improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake by muscle cells, reduced systemic inflammation, improved lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, favorable changes in body composition, and enhanced cardiovascular fitness. Exercise can be broadly categorized into aerobic training, resistance training, combined training, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT), each potentially offering distinct advantages for individuals with T2DM.\n\nWhile numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the effects of exercise on T2DM, the evidence base is continually expanding with new studies. Furthermore, existing reviews often focus on specific exercise modalities or a limited set of outcomes, or may not incorporate the most recent high-quality evidence. There is a need for a comprehensive, up-to-date synthesis that examines a broad range of structured exercise interventions against usual care or no-exercise controls, evaluating their efficacy across key glycemic, cardiometabolic, anthropometric, fitness, and quality of life outcomes, while also assessing their safety profile.\n\nThis systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and robust summary of the current evidence on the effects of various structured exercise interventions on adults with T2DM. By systematically identifying, appraising, and synthesizing the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we seek to inform clinical practice, guide future research, and ultimately contribute to improved health outcomes for individuals living with T2DM.\n\n**2b. Objectives**\n\nThe primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of structured exercise interventions on glycemic control, as measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nSecondary objectives include assessing the effects of structured exercise interventions on:\n*   Other markers of glycemic control: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).\n*   Cardiometabolic risk factors: lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\n*   Body composition: body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat percentage.\n*   Physical fitness: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) or other objective measures of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n*   Health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n*   Safety: incidence and type of adverse events.\n\nExploratory objectives include conducting subgroup analyses to investigate potential moderators of treatment effect, such as:\n*   Type of exercise intervention (e.g., aerobic, resistance, combined, HIIT).\n*   Intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise.\n*   Supervision status (supervised vs. unsupervised).\n*   Duration of the intervention.\n*   Baseline characteristics of participants (e.g., age, sex, diabetes duration, baseline HbA1c, BMI).\n\n---\n\n**3. Methods**\n\nThis systematic review protocol has been developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement.\n\n**3a. Eligibility Criteria**\n\n*   **Study Design:** Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be included.\n*   **Participants (P):** Adults (\u226518 years old) diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or geographical location. Studies including participants with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus or gestational diabetes will be excluded.\n*   **Intervention (I):** Any structured exercise intervention (e.g., aerobic training, resistance training, combined aerobic and resistance training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), flexibility, balance training, or combinations thereof). The exercise intervention must be planned and systematic, with clearly defined parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, type).\n*   **Comparator (C):** Usual care, standard diabetes education, no exercise, or minimal physical activity advice. Studies comparing different types or doses of exercise interventions against each other (e.g., aerobic vs. resistance) will be excluded unless one arm also serves as a true control group.\n*   **Outcomes (O):** Studies must report at least one of the following outcomes:\n    *   **Primary Outcome:** Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, reported in %).\n    *   **Secondary Outcomes:** Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat percentage, VO2max or other objective fitness measures, health-related quality of life scores, and adverse events.\n*   **Language:** Studies published in English will be included.\n*   **Publication Status:** No restrictions on publication date. Both published and unpublished (e.g., conference abstracts, theses where sufficient data is available) studies will be considered, if accessible and peer-reviewed.\n\n**3b. Information Sources**\n\nA comprehensive search will be conducted across the following electronic databases from their inception to the present date:\n*   PubMed/MEDLINE\n*   Embase\n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n*   Web of Science (Core Collection)\n*   Scopus\n\nTo identify ongoing or recently completed trials, we will search clinical trial registries:\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)\n\nAdditionally, the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews will be manually searched for additional eligible studies. Google Scholar will be used for targeted searches if necessary to identify grey literature or studies not captured by the primary database search.\n\n**3c. Search Strategy**\n\nThe search strategy will be developed in consultation with a medical librarian and will be tailored for each database using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, Emtree terms, and keywords related to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and exercise interventions. Boolean operators (AND, OR) will be used to combine terms. The search will not be limited by date.\n\n**Example Search Strategy for PubMed/MEDLINE:**\n\n1.  **Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2:**\n    *   \u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Diabetes, Type 2\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022NIDDM\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Adult-Onset Diabetes\u0022[tiab]\n2.  **Exercise/Physical Activity:**\n    *   \u0022Exercise\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Physical Activity\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Exercise Therapy\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Resistance Training\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022High-Intensity Interval Training\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022HIIT\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Aerobic Training\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Strength Training\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Physical Training\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Exercise Program\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Physical Exercise\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Workout\u0022[tiab]\n3.  **Study Design:**\n    *   \u0022Randomized Controlled Trial\u0022[pt] OR \u0022Controlled Clinical Trial\u0022[pt] OR \u0022Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Random Allocation\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Double-Blind Method\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Single-Blind Method\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022RCT\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022Randomly Assigned\u0022[tiab]\n4.  **Combine:**\n    *   (#1) AND (#2) AND (#3)\n\nThe full search strategy for all databases will be provided as an appendix to the published review.\n\n**3d. Study Selection Process**\n\nFollowing the database searches, all identified citations will be imported into a reference management software (e.g., EndNote, Covidence). Duplicate records will be removed.\nTwo independent reviewers will then screen the titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria. Studies deemed potentially relevant by at least one reviewer will proceed to full-text review.\nFull-text articles will be retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. Any disagreements between reviewers at both the title/abstract and full-text screening stages will be resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by a third independent reviewer.\nReasons for exclusion of full-text articles will be documented. A PRISMA flow diagram will illustrate the study selection process.\n\n**3e. Data Collection Process**\n\nTwo independent reviewers will extract data from the included studies using a standardized, pre-piloted data extraction form. The form will be piloted on a small subset of studies (e.g., 2-3 studies) and refined as needed to ensure consistency and completeness. Any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer.\nIf essential data are missing from a study, the reviewers will attempt to contact the corresponding authors to request the information.\n\n**3f. Data Items**\n\nThe following data will be extracted from each eligible study:\n\n*   **Study Characteristics:**\n    *   Author(s), year of publication, country of study, funding source.\n    *   Study design (e.g., parallel, crossover).\n    *   Setting (e.g., hospital, community).\n    *   Duration of follow-up.\n*   **Participant Characteristics:**\n    *   Total number of participants randomized and analyzed in each arm.\n    *   Age (mean \u00B1 SD), sex (% female).\n    *   Baseline BMI (mean \u00B1 SD).\n    *   Duration of diabetes (mean \u00B1 SD).\n    *   Baseline HbA1c (mean \u00B1 SD).\n    *   Other relevant comorbidities or medications.\n*   **Intervention Characteristics:**\n    *   Detailed description of the exercise intervention (type, frequency per week, duration per session, intensity, total weekly duration).\n    *   Supervision status (supervised, unsupervised, mixed).\n    *   Comparator group details (e.g., usual care, education).\n*   **Outcome Data:**\n    *   Mean and standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) for all primary and secondary outcomes at baseline and post-intervention (or change from baseline).\n    *   Number of participants analyzed for each outcome in each group.\n    *   Units of measurement for all outcomes.\n    *   Information on adverse events (number, type, severity) in both intervention and control groups.\n\n**3g. Risk of Bias Assessment**\n\nThe methodological quality and risk of bias of each included RCT will be independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) tool for randomized trials. This tool assesses bias across five domains:\n1.  Bias arising from the randomization process.\n2.  Bias due to deviations from intended interventions.\n3.  Bias due to missing outcome data.\n4.  Bias in measurement of the outcome.\n5.  Bias in selection of the reported result.\n\nEach domain will be rated as \u0022low risk,\u0022 \u0022some concerns,\u0022 or \u0022high risk\u0022 of bias. An overall risk of bias judgment will be assigned to each study. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by a third reviewer. The findings of the risk of bias assessment will be considered during data synthesis and interpretation, particularly when assessing the certainty of evidence using GRADE.\n\n**3h. Data Synthesis**\n\n**Qualitative Synthesis:**\nA narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies, summarizing key characteristics, intervention details, and reported outcomes. If meta-analysis is not possible due to excessive heterogeneity, insufficient data, or disparate outcome reporting, a detailed descriptive summary of the findings will be provided.\n\n**Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-analysis):**\nIf sufficient data are available from at least two comparable studies, quantitative meta-analysis will be performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software (version 5.4, Cochrane Training) or R statistical software with the \u0027meta\u0027 package.\n\n*   **Effect Measures:** For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) will be used when outcomes are measured on the same scale (e.g., HbA1c in %). Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) will be used when outcomes are measured using different scales or units (e.g., different HRQoL questionnaires). For adverse events, relative risks (RR) or odds ratios (OR) will be calculated for dichotomous outcomes.\n*   **Statistical Model:** A random-effects model will be used for all meta-analyses, considering the anticipated clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies.\n*   **Heterogeneity Assessment:** Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the Chi-squared test (with a p-value \u003C 0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity) and the I\u00B2 statistic (I\u00B2 \u003C 25% for low heterogeneity, 25-50% for moderate, 50-75% for substantial, and \u003E 75% for considerable heterogeneity).\n*   **Subgroup Analysis:** Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be conducted where sufficient data allow, to explore potential sources of heterogeneity, as outlined in the \u0022Exploratory Objectives\u0022 section (e.g., by exercise type, intervention duration, supervision, baseline HbA1c).\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the findings. These may include:\n    *   Excluding studies deemed to have an overall high risk of bias.\n    *   Excluding studies with very short intervention durations (e.g., \u003C 8 weeks).\n    *   Excluding studies where data were imputed or obtained through author contact.\n*   **Publication Bias:** Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots visually for outcomes with at least 10 studies. Egger\u0027s test will be performed if appropriate. Asymmetry in the funnel plot or a statistically significant Egger\u0027s test may indicate publication bias.\n\n**3i. Confidence in Cumulative Evidence (GRADE)**\n\nThe certainty of the evidence for each primary and key secondary outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This framework considers five domains: risk of bias, inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness, imprecision (sample size, confidence intervals), and publication bias. The certainty of evidence will be rated as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\n---\n\n**4. Ethics and Dissemination**\n\n**4a. Ethics Approval**\n\nEthical approval is not required for this systematic review as it will synthesize data from previously published or publicly available studies and will not involve human participants or directly collect primary data.\n\n**4b. Dissemination**\n\nThe findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The results will also be disseminated through presentations at relevant national and international conferences. The full PROSPERO registration details will be included in the final publication.\n\n---\n\n**5. Amendments**\n\nAny amendments made to this protocol after PROSPERO registration will be clearly documented with the date of amendment, a description of the change, and the rationale for the change, and will be updated in the PROSPERO registry.\n\n---\n\n**6.

According to the International Diabetes Federation (2021), approximately 537 million adults aged 20-79 years lived with diabetes in 2021, with T2DM accounting for 90-95% of cases. This number is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045, imposing a significant economic burden estimated at USD 966 billion annually in healthcare costs (IDF Diabetes Atlas, 2021). Lifestyle interventions, particularly exercise, are recommended as first-line therapies by guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2023) and World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), emphasizing their role in improving insulin sensitivity, promoting weight loss, and reducing HbA1c levels\u2014a key marker of long-term glycemic control.\n\nExercise interventions encompass diverse modalities, including aerobic activities (e.g., walking, cycling), resistance training (e.g., weightlifting), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and combined programs. Meta-analyses suggest exercise can lower HbA1c by 0.5-1.0% (Umpierre et al., 2011, JAMA; Liu et al., 2019, Diabetes Care), comparable to some pharmacological agents. However, existing evidence is inconsistent due to heterogeneity in intervention design, duration, intensity, and participant characteristics (e.g., age, baseline HbA1c, comorbidities). For instance, a 2017 Cochrane Review by Umpierre et al. focused on supervised vs. unsupervised exercise but excluded non-English studies and short-term trials (\u003C12 weeks), potentially biasing results. More recent trials, such as the Diabetes Aerobic and Resistance Training (DART) study (Sigal et al., 2007, Annals of Internal Medicine), highlight benefits of combined aerobic-resistance training, yet synthesis across populations (e.g., ethnic minorities, older adults) is limited.\n\nGaps in the literature include: (1) Insufficient integration of digital or home-based exercise post-COVID-19, which may enhance adherence (Chaudhry et al., 2022, JMIR mHealth); (2) Underexplored moderators like sex, BMI, or medication use, as noted in a 2020 umbrella review (Hamasaki, 2020, Nutrients); (3) Limited focus on patient-centered outcomes beyond HbA1c, such as quality of life or adherence barriers (Colberg et al., 2016, Diabetes Care). Without a comprehensive update, clinicians lack evidence-based guidance on tailoring exercise for diverse T2DM subgroups, potentially hindering implementation in primary care.\n\nThis systematic review is warranted to consolidate high-quality evidence, address these gaps, and inform updated guidelines. By focusing on RCTs with \u22658 weeks of intervention, we aim to provide robust estimates of effect sizes and heterogeneity sources, ultimately supporting personalized exercise prescriptions.\n\n### Review Objectives (PRISMA-P Item 9)\n- **Primary Objective**: To evaluate the effectiveness of structured exercise interventions (aerobic, resistance, HIIT, or combined) compared to no exercise or usual care on glycemic control (change in HbA1c) in adults with T2DM.\n- **Secondary Objectives**:\n  - Assess effects on secondary outcomes (e.g., fasting glucose, insulin resistance, body weight, cardiovascular risk factors).\n  - Explore subgroup effects (e.g., by exercise type, duration, intensity, population demographics).\n  - Identify barriers/facilitators to adherence.\n\n*(State objectives using PICOS framework: Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Study Design.)*\n\n## Methods (PRISMA-P Items 10-27)\n*(Detail every step to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract\n**Abstract:** This protocol outlines the methodology for a systematic review aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of exercise interventions in managing diabetes. The review will adhere to the PRISMA-P guidelines to ensure transparency and rigor. The primary objective is to synthesize evidence on the impact of different types of exercise on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and other health outcomes in individuals with diabetes.\n\n#### 3. Background\n\n##### 3.1 Rationale\nDiabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. It is a significant global health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide. Effective management of diabetes is crucial to prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Exercise has been recognized as a cornerstone of diabetes management, alongside diet and medication. However, the specific types, intensities, and durations of exercise that are most effective remain areas of ongoing research.\n\n##### 3.2 Objectives\nThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of various exercise interventions in improving glycemic control and other health outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Secondary objectives include:\n1. Identifying the most effective types of exercise (e.g., aerobic, resistance, combined).\n2. Assessing the impact of exercise intensity and duration on outcomes.\n3. Evaluating the long-term sustainability and adherence to exercise interventions.\n4. Examining the safety and adverse effects of exercise interventions in this population.\n\n##### 3.3 Research Questions\n1. What are the effects of different types of exercise interventions on glycemic control in individuals with diabetes?\n2. How do exercise intensity and duration influence health outcomes in individuals with diabetes?\n3. What are the long-term effects and adherence rates of exercise interventions in diabetes management?\n4. What are the safety considerations and adverse effects associated with exercise interventions in individuals with diabetes?\n\n##### 3.4 Methods\n\n###### 3.4.1 Eligibility Criteria\n**Inclusion Criteria:**\n- **Population:** Adults (\u226518 years) with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n- **Intervention:** Any form of structured exercise intervention, including aerobic, resistance, or combined training.\n- **Comparison:** Standard care, no intervention, or other types of exercise interventions.\n- **Outcomes:** Primary outcomes include glycemic control (HbA1c levels) and insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include body composition, cardiovascular health, quality of life, and adverse events.\n- **Study Design:** Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and prospective cohort studies.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria:**\n- Studies not reporting on the primary outcomes.\n- Studies with a follow-up period of less than 12 weeks.\n- Non-English language publications.\n\n###### 3.4.2 Information Sources\nThe following databases will be searched:\n- MEDLINE (via PubMed)\n- Embase\n- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n- CINAHL\n- Web of Science\n- ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n###### 3.4.3 Search Strategy\nA comprehensive search strategy will be developed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords related to diabetes, exercise, and clinical trials. The search strategy will be adapted for each database. An example search strategy for MEDLINE is provided below:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n(\u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR \u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR \u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR \u0022diabetes\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022diabetic\u0022[tiab]) AND (\u0022Exercise\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR \u0022Physical Activity\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR \u0022exercise\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022physical activity\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022training\u0022[tiab]) AND (\u0022Clinical Trial\u0022[Publication Type] OR \u0022Randomized Controlled Trial\u0022[Publication Type] OR \u0022randomized\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022RCT\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022trial\u0022[tiab])\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n###### 3.4.4 Study Selection\nTwo independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text articles will be retrieved for studies that meet the inclusion criteria or where there is uncertainty. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.\n\n###### 3.4.5 Data Collection Process\nData will be extracted using a standardized data extraction form. Two reviewers will independently extract data, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.\n\n###### 3.4.6 Data Items\nThe following data items will be extracted:\n- Study characteristics (author, year, country, study design)\n- Participant characteristics (age, sex, type of diabetes, duration of diabetes)\n- Intervention details (type, intensity, duration, frequency)\n- Comparison details\n- Outcome measures (HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, body composition, cardiovascular health, quality of life, adverse events)\n\n###### 3.4.7 Risk of Bias Assessment\nThe risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. Two reviewers will independently assess the risk of bias, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.\n\n###### 3.4.8 Data Synthesis\nA narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided. If appropriate, a meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I\u00B2 statistic. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on the type of diabetes, type of exercise, and duration of intervention.\n\n###### 3.4.9 Meta-Bias Assessment\nPublication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger\u0027s test if there are at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis.\n\n###### 3.4.10 Confidence in Cumulative Evidence\nThe strength of the evidence will be assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.\n\n#### 4. Ethics and Dissemination\nThis systematic review does not require ethical approval as it will be based on published data. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant conferences.\n\n#### 5. Registration and Protocol Amendments\nThis protocol will be registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). Any amendments to the protocol will be documented and reported in the final manuscript.\n\n#### 6. References\n[Include relevant references supporting the background and methodology]\n\n---\n\nThis protocol provides a comprehensive framework for conducting a systematic review on exercise interventions for diabetes management. By following the PRISMA-P guidelines, you ensure that your review is transparent, rigorous, and reproducible."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
