General Broad Searches (Start here):**\n*   \u0060(\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022distributed ledger technology\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022) AND (\u0022application\u0022 OR \u0022use case\u0022 OR \u0022solution\u0022)\u0060\n*   \u0060(\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022) AND (\u0022review\u0022 OR \u0022survey\u0022 OR \u0022mapping study\u0022) AND (\u0022application\u0022 OR \u0022use case\u0022)\u0060 (This is critical to find existing literature reviews that can save you significant time by providing a pre-categorized overview).\n\n**2. Sector-Specific Searches (Iterate for each major sector):**\n*   \u0060(\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022) AND (\u0022finance\u0022 OR \u0022banking\u0022 OR \u0022fintech\u0022 OR \u0022DeFi\u0022) AND (\u0022application\u0022 OR \u0022use case\u0022)\u0060\n*   \u0060(\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022) AND (\u0022supply chain\u0022 OR \u0022logistics\u0022 OR \u0022traceability\u0022) AND (\u0022application\u0022 OR \u0022use case\u0022)\u0060\n*   \u0060(\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022) AND (\u0022healthcare\u0022 OR \u0022medical records\u0022 OR \u0022pharma\u0022) AND (\u0022application\u0022 OR \u0022use case\u0022)\u0060\n\n**3. Refine with Advanced Operators:**\n*   **Boolean Operators:** \u0060AND\u0060, \u0060OR\u0060, \u0060NOT\u0060 (e.g., \u0060blockchain AND application NOT cryptocurrency\u0060)\n*   **Phrase Searching:** Use quotation marks for exact phrases (e.g., \u0060\u0022smart contract\u0022\u0060, \u0060\u0022supply chain traceability\u0022\u0060).\n*   **Wildcards/Truncation:** Use \u0060*\u0060 to find variations (e.g., \u0060blockchai*\u0060 finds blockchain, blockchains; \u0060securit*\u0060 finds security, securities).\n*   **Field Searching:** Most databases allow searching within specific fields (e.g., \u0060TITLE(\u0022blockchain application\u0022)\u0060, \u0060ABSTRACT(\u0022supply chain\u0022)\u0060, \u0060KEYWORDS(\u0022DLT\u0022)\u0060).\n*   **Proximity Operators:** (e.g., \u0060blockchain NEAR/3 supply chain\u0060 \u2013 finds \u0022blockchain\u0022 within 3 words of \u0022supply chain\u0022).\n\n**Example Search String Structure (for Scopus/Web of Science):**\n\n\u0060(TITLE-ABS-KEY (\u0022blockchain\u0022 OR \u0022distributed ledger technology\u0022 OR \u0022DLT\u0022)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY (\u0022application*\u0022 OR \u0022use case*\u0022 OR \u0022solution*\u0022 OR \u0022implement*\u0022 OR \u0022framework*\u0022)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY (\u0022finance\u0022 OR \u0022banking\u0022 OR \u0022fintech\u0022 OR \u0022DeFi\u0022 OR \u0022supply chain\u0022 OR \u0022logistics\u0022 OR \u0022healthcare\u0022 OR \u0022medical\u0022 OR \u0022energy\u0022 OR \u0022government\u0022 OR \u0022public sector\u0022 OR \u0022real estate\u0022 OR \u0022media\u0022 OR \u0022IoT\u0022 OR \u0022education\u0022 OR \u0022agriculture\u0022 OR \u0022legaltech\u0022))\u0060\n*Adjust the list of sectors for a broader or more focused initial search.*\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Executing the Search and Initial Filtering\n\n**1. Systematic Approach:**\n*   Keep a log of your search queries, the databases used, the date, and the number of results obtained. This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.\n*   Start with broad searches, then progressively refine.\n\n**2. Apply Filters:**\n*   **Publication Year:** Limit to recent years (e.g., last 5-7 years). If you find a seminal paper, you can expand.\n*   **Document Type:** Filter for \u0022Article,\u0022 \u0022Conference Paper,\u0022 \u0022Review,\u0022 \u0022Survey.\u0022\n*   **Language:** English.\n*   **Subject Area:** If available, filter to relevant areas like Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Social Sciences.\n\n**3. Initial Scan (Title \u0026 Abstract Review):**\n*   Rapidly go through the titles and abstracts of the search results.\n*   Look for direct relevance to blockchain *applications* in *different sectors*.\n*   Exclude papers focused solely on the underlying cryptographic principles, pure technical optimizations, or specific cryptocurrency trading (unless directly related to a financial application).\n\n**4. Citation Analysis \u0026 Snowballing:**\n*   Once you find highly relevant papers (especially review articles or highly cited papers), use their reference lists to identify other important works (backward snowballing).\n*   Look for papers that cite these key papers (forward snowballing) \u2013 this can reveal newer, related research.\n\n**5. Reference Management:**\n*   Use a reference manager from the start (e.g., **Zotero**, **Mendeley**, **EndNote**).\n*   Import all potentially relevant papers. This allows you to deduplicate, organize, add tags (e.g., by sector, application type), and make notes for future analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6: Initial Scan and Iteration\n\n**1. Deduplicate:** Reference managers will help you identify and remove duplicate entries.\n**2. Read Abstracts \u0026 Keywords:** For the remaining papers, read abstracts and keywords more carefully. Assign preliminary tags or categories (e.g., \u0022Finance-Payments,\u0022 \u0022Supply Chain-Traceability,\u0022 \u0022Healthcare-EHR\u0022).\n**3. Refine Keywords \u0026 Re-Search:** Based on the common themes and specific application terms you discover in the initial scan, refine your keywords. You might find new, more specific terms for sectors or applications that you hadn\u0027t initially considered.\n**4. Identify Gaps:** Note if certain sectors or application types seem underrepresented \u2013 this might be a genuine gap or an indication that your keywords aren\u0027t capturing them.\n\n---\n\n### Tools for Search Management:\n\n*   **Reference Managers (Zotero/Mendeley):** Essential for organizing, deduplicating, and tagging papers.\n*   **Spreadsheet (Excel/Google Sheets):** For an initial manual triage if you have too many results, or to log your search strings and result counts. You can also export metadata from reference managers to a spreadsheet for easier initial high-level categorization.\n*   **Mind Mapping Software (e.g., XMind, Miro, Lucidchart):** Even at this stage, you can start jotting down emerging sectors and application clusters as you find them, providing a very nascent \u0022visual map.\u0022\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you\u0027ll build a robust and comprehensive collection of literature that forms the foundation for your visual map. The next stage will involve detailed data extraction, categorization, and actual visualization. Good luck!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
