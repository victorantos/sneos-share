  :responses='{"Claude": "# Searching for Grey Literature (Reports)\n\nGrey literature refers to research and information produced outside traditional commercial publishing channels. Here are effective strategies for finding reports and other grey literature:\n\n## **Specialized Databases \u0026 Repositories**\n\n### **General Grey Literature**\n- **OpenGrey** (opengrey.eu) - European grey literature\n- **OAISTER** - Worldwide grey literature collection\n- **Grey Literature Report** - New York Academy of Medicine\n- **GreyNet International** - Grey literature network\n\n### **Government Reports**\n- **USA.gov** - U.S. government reports\n- **GovInfo** (govinfo.gov) - Federal publications\n- **ERIC** - Education reports\n- **NTIS** - National Technical Information Service\n- **EUR-Lex** - European Union documents\n\n### **International Organizations**\n- **World Bank Open Knowledge Repository**\n- **WHO Library** - World Health Organization\n- **OECD iLibrary**\n- **UN Digital Library**\n- **IMF eLibrary**\n\n## **Search Strategies**\n\n### **Google Advanced Search**\n- Use \u0060filetype:pdf\u0060 to find reports\n- Search specific domains: \u0060site:.gov\u0060 or \u0060site:.org\u0060\n- Example: \u0060\u0022climate change\u0022 filetype:pdf site:.gov\u0060\n\n### **Google Scholar**\n- Check \u0022cited by\u0022 references\n- Look for working papers and technical reports\n\n### **Think Tanks \u0026 Research Institutions**\n- Search directly on organization websites\n- Examples: Brookings, RAND Corporation, Pew Research\n\n## **Subject-Specific Resources**\n\n**What\u0027s your field of interest?** I can provide more targeted resources for:\n- Health/Medicine\n- Social sciences\n- Education\n- Business/Economics\n- Environment\n- Technology\n- Policy/Politics\n\nWould you like specific guidance for your topic area?", "Grok": "### What is Grey Literature?\nGrey literature refers to publicly available materials that are not formally published through commercial channels, such as government reports, theses, conference proceedings, policy papers, and technical documents. Your query mentions \u0022reports,\u0022 so I\u0027ll focus on strategies for searching those, while covering broader grey lit sources.\n\n### Key Strategies for Searching Grey Literature\nTo effectively search, use a mix of specialized databases, search engines, and institutional repositories. Grey lit is often not indexed in mainstream academic databases like PubMed or Google Scholar, so targeted tools are essential.\n\n1. **Specialized Databases and Repositories**:\n   - **GreyLit.org**: A free aggregator focused on U.S. government reports and technical documents. Search by keywords like \u0022climate change reports\u0022 for environmental topics.\n   - **OpenGrey**: Indexes over 4 million entries from Europe, including reports, theses, and conference papers. Access via the INIST-CNRS platform; it\u0027s free but may require registration.\n   - **ETD Repositories** (e.g., ProQuest Dissertations \u0026 Theses Global or NDLTD): Great for unpublished theses and reports. Many universities host open-access versions.\n   - **World Bank Open Knowledge Repository**: Excellent for global development reports; searchable by topic, region, or year.\n   - **WHO IRIS or CDC Stacks**: For health-related reports from international organizations.\n\n2. **Search Engines and Tools**:\n   - **Google Scholar**: Add \u0022filetype:pdf site:.gov\u0022 or \u0022site:.org\u0022 to filter for reports. Use advanced operators like \u0022grey literature\u0022 \u002B your topic.\n   - **BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine)**: Indexes grey lit from 6,000\u002B sources; filters for reports and documents.\n   - **Scopus or Web of Science**: These include grey lit sections; check their \u0022conference proceedings\u0022 or \u0022reports\u0022 filters.\n\n3. **Institutional and Government Sources**:\n   - Search national libraries or agencies: U.S. (NTIS for technical reports, GPO for federal docs), UK (British Library), EU (EUR-Lex for policy reports).\n   - University repositories (e.g., via DART-Europe for European theses) often host departmental reports.\n\n### Tips for Effective Searching\n- **Keywords**: Use broad terms like \u0022report\u0022 \u002B your topic (e.g., \u0022COVID-19 impact report\u0022). Include synonyms (e.g., \u0022white paper,\u0022 \u0022working paper\u0022).\n- **Date and Language Filters**: Grey lit can be timely; sort by publication date. Tools like OpenGrey support multiple languages.\n- **Citation Tracking**: Once you find a report, use tools like CitedBy or ResearchRabbit to discover related grey lit.\n- **Systematic Reviews**: If for research, follow guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook or RAMSES-II for reproducible grey lit searches.\n- **Challenges**: Grey lit may not be peer-reviewed, so evaluate sources for credibility (author affiliation, date, methodology).\n\nIf you provide more details (e.g., topic, field like health/environment, or geographic focus), I can refine this with specific examples or links. For instance, are you looking for reports on a particular subject?"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
