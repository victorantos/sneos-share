Just ask! Happy API testing! \uD83D\uDE80", "DeepSeek": "Of course! This is a comprehensive Postman tutorial for beginners. We\u0027ll start from the very basics and build up to key concepts.\n\n### What is Postman?\n\nPostman is a powerful API platform used for building and using APIs. In simple terms, it\u0027s a tool that lets you send requests to a web server and get responses back, without having to write code for a full application. It\u0027s used by developers and testers for:\n\n* **API Testing:** Checking if an API works as expected.\n* **API Development:** Building and debugging APIs.\n* **Documentation:** Creating and sharing API documentation.\n* **Mock Servers:** Simulating an API before the real one is built.\n* **Automation:** Running collections of requests automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Installation and Setup\n\n1. **Download Postman:** Go to [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and download the app for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). The desktop app is recommended over the web version for full functionality.\n2. **Sign Up / Log In:** You can create a free Postman account. This allows you to save your work and sync it across devices.\n\nWhen you open Postman, you\u0027ll see a workspace. For now, the \u0022My Workspace\u0022 is perfect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Your First API Request (GET)\n\nWe\u0027ll start with a simple public API that requires no authentication.\n\n1. **Open a New Tab:** Click the **\u002B** button to open a new request tab.\n2. **Select the HTTP Method:** From the dropdown left of the URL bar, select **GET**.\n3. **Enter the Request URL:** Type the following URL:\n \u0060https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1\u0060\n This is a fake online REST API for testing. This specific URL will get the data for a post with ID \u00601\u0060.\n4. **Click \u0022Send\u0022:** Hit the big blue **Send** button.\n\n![Postman GET Request](https://i.imgur.com/3f5R2Bq.png)\n\n**Congratulations!** You\u0027ve made your first API call. You should see a \u0060200 OK\u0060 status and a JSON response in the bottom panel showing the details of a post.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Postman Interface\n\nLet\u0027s break down the key areas you just used:\n\n1. **HTTP Method:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Defines the type of action you want to perform.\n2. **Request URL (Endpoint):** The address of the API you want to talk to.\n3. **Params:** Used to send query parameters (e.g., \u0060?userId=1\u0060 in a URL).\n4. **Headers:** Key-Value pairs that send additional information about the request (e.g., \u0060Content-Type: application/json\u0060).\n5. **Body:** Where you put the data you want to send to the server (used for POST, PUT, etc.).\n6. **Response Section:**\n * **Status:** The HTTP status code (e.g., \u0060200 OK\u0060, \u0060404 Not Found\u0060, \u0060500 Internal Server Error\u0060).\n * **Time:** How long the request took.\n * **Size:** The size of the response.\n * **Body:** The actual data returned by the server. You can view it as Pretty (formatted), Raw (plain text), or Preview (for HTML).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Making a POST Request\n\nA GET request *retrieves* data. A POST request *creates* new data.\n\nLet\u0027s create a new post on the same mock API.\n\n1. **Change the Method:** Select **POST** from the dropdown.\n2. **Change the URL:** Use \u0060https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\u0060. (Notice we are not targeting a specific ID like \u0060/1\u0060).\n3. **Set Headers:** Go to the \u0022Headers\u0022 tab. Add a new key:\n * **Key:** \u0060Content-Type\u0060\n * **Value:** \u0060application/json\u0060\n4. **Set Body:** Go to the \u0022Body\u0022 tab.\n * Select the **raw** radio button.\n * From the dropdown next to \u0022raw\u0022, select **JSON**.\n * Enter the following JSON data:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060json\n {\n \u0022title\u0022: \u0022My First Post via Postman\u0022,\n \u0022body\u0022: \u0022This is the body of the post created by a beginner!\u0022,\n \u0022userId\u0022: 1\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n5. **Click Send.**\n\nYou should get a \u0060201 Created\u0060 status code, and the response body will be the new \u0022post\u0022 object you just sent, complete with a new ID (which will be \u0060101\u0060 since it\u0027s a fake API).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Organizing Requests with Collections\n\nYou don\u0027t want to lose your requests. **Collections** are folders to group and save your API requests.\n\n1. **Create a Collection:** On the left sidebar, click **Collections \u003E \u002B**.\n2. **Name It:** Call it \u0022My First API Tests\u0022.\n3. **Save Your Requests:** Go back to your request tabs. Click the **Save** button, give your request a name (e.g., \u0022Create New Post\u0022), and select your new collection to save it into.\n\nYou can now find all your saved requests in the collection. This is essential for organization and the next step: automation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Using Variables\n\nVariables make your requests dynamic and reusable. The most common is the **Collection Variable** for a base URL.\n\n1. **Edit Your Collection:** Hover over your collection, click the **...** (three dots) and select **Edit**.\n2. **Go to the Variables Tab:** We\u0027ll add a variable for our base URL.\n3. **Add a Variable:**\n * **Variable:** \u0060base_url\u0060\n * **Initial Value:** \u0060https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\u0060\n * **Current Value:** (Leave it the same for now).\n4. **Click Update.**\n\n5. **Use the Variable in a Request:** Open one of your saved requests. Change the URL from the full address to use the variable.\n * **Old URL:** \u0060https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\u0060\n * **New URL:** \u0060{{base_url}}/posts\u0060\n\nPostman will replace \u0060{{base_url}}\u0060 with the real value when you send the request. This is incredibly useful if you switch between development, testing, and production environments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Writing Simple Tests (Tests Scripts)\n\nPostman has a powerful feature where you can write JavaScript code to automatically verify your API responses.\n\n1. **Go to the \u0022Tests\u0022 Tab:** In your request, this tab is next to \u0022Body\u0022.\n2. **Write a Test:** Let\u0027s write a test to check if the status code is \u0060200\u0060. On the right, you\u0027ll see snippets. Click on **\u0022Status code: Code is 200\u0022**.\n\n This will generate the following code:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\n pm.test(\u0022Status code is 200\u0022, function () {\n pm.response.to.have.status(200);\n });\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n3. **Send the Request.** After you get the response, go to the **\u0022Test Results\u0022** tab in the response section. You should see 1 test passing.\n\nYou can write tests for almost anything: response time, response body content, headers, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps \u0026 Best Practices\n\nYou\u0027ve learned the core workflow! Here\u0027s where to go from here:\n\n* **Environments:** Use environments to manage variables for different setups (e.g., \u0060dev_base_url\u0060, \u0060prod_base_url\u0060).\n* **Authentication:** Explore the \u0022Authorization\u0022 tab to learn how to handle API Keys, Bearer Tokens, and OAuth.\n* **Running Collections:** Click the **\u0022Run\u0022** button on your collection to run all requests in a sequence. This is how you automate your API tests.\n* **Documenting Your API:** Use the description fields in your collections and requests to document what each API does. This is great for sharing with your team.\n\n### Summary of Common HTTP Methods in Postman\n\n| Method | Description | When to Use in Postman |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **GET** | Retrieve data. | Getting user info, fetching a list of products.
