  :responses='{"DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) checklist, broken down into the four core principles (POUR) and key success criteria.\n\nThis checklist is based on **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**, which is the standard most organizations aim to meet for legal compliance and good practice. Level A is the minimum, and Level AAA is the highest (and often not achievable for all content).\n\n---\n\n### The Four Principles of Accessibility (POUR)\n\nAll guidelines fall under one of these four principles. For a website to be accessible, it must be:\n\n1. **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.\n2. **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.\n3. **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.\n4. **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.\n\n---\n\n### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Checklist\n\n#### Principle 1: Perceivable\n\n**Text Alternatives**\n- [ ] **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A):** All non-text content (images, icons, charts, etc.) has a text alternative.\n - **Images:** Use descriptive \u0060alt\u0060 text (e.g., \u0060alt=\u0022A person using a laptop at a coffee shop\u0022\u0060).\n - **Decorative Images:** Use empty \u0060alt\u0060 text (\u0060alt=\u0022\u0022\u0060).\n - **Complex Images:** Provide a longer description in the text or via a link.\n\n**Time-based Media**\n- [ ] **1.2.2 Captions (Pre-recorded) (Level A):** Synchronized captions are provided for all pre-recorded audio content in videos.\n- [ ] **1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Level A):** An audio description or full text transcript is provided for pre-recorded video content.\n- [ ] **1.2.5 Audio Description (Pre-recorded) (Level AA):** Audio description is provided for all pre-recorded video content.\n\n**Adaptable**\n- [ ] **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):** Semantic HTML is used to convey structure and meaning.\n - Use proper heading tags (\u0060\u003Ch1\u003E\u0060 to \u0060\u003Ch6\u003E\u0060) in a logical order.\n - Use lists (\u0060\u003Cul\u003E\u0060, \u0060\u003Col\u003E\u0060, \u0060\u003Cli\u003E\u0060) for list content.\n - Use table headers (\u0060\u003Cth\u003E\u0060) for data tables.\n- [ ] **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A):** The reading and navigation order (determined by the code order) is logical and intuitive.\n- [ ] **1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A):** Instructions do not rely solely on sensory characteristics like shape, color, size, or visual location (e.g., \u0022Click the round button\u0022 or \u0022See the menu on the right\u0022).\n- [ ] **1.3.4 Orientation (Level AA):** Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation (portrait or landscape), unless essential (e.g., a bank check).\n- [ ] **1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (Level AA):** The purpose of input fields (e.g., \u0022name\u0022, \u0022email\u0022) can be programmatically determined, helping browsers autofill fields accurately.\n\n**Distinguishable**\n- [ ] **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):** Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, or prompting a response (e.g., form errors should have an icon or text in addition to red color).\n- [ ] **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):** The contrast ratio between text and its background is at least **4.5:1** (or 3:1 for large text).\n- [ ] **1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA):** Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.\n- [ ] **1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA):** Text is used instead of images of text, unless the image of text is essential (e.g., a logo).\n- [ ] **1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA):** Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions, at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels.

Addressing these issues is critical.\n * **Level AA:** The generally accepted target for most websites. Many laws and guidelines require Level AA compliance.\n * **Level AAA:** The highest level of accessibility. While desirable, it\u0027s often not feasible for all content due to practical limitations. Consider these guidelines where possible, but don\u0027t let the pursuit of AAA prevent you from achieving A and AA.\n\n2. **Testing is Essential:** This checklist is a guide, but manual and automated testing are crucial to verify compliance.\n\n3. **Tools:** Utilize accessibility testing tools (both automated and manual) throughout the development process. Some popular tools include:\n * **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool):** A browser extension for quick checks.\n * **Lighthouse (Google Chrome DevTools):** Provides accessibility audits.\n * **axe DevTools:** Browser extension and CLI tool for automated accessibility testing.\n * **Screen Readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS):** Essential for testing the experience for screen reader users.\n * **Color Contrast Analyzers:** To verify sufficient contrast.\n\n4. **Context Matters:** Accessibility is not just about following rules; it\u0027s about creating a usable experience for *all* users. Consider the context of your content and your target audience.\n\n5. **Involve Users with Disabilities:** The best way to ensure accessibility is to involve people with disabilities in the design and testing process. Get their feedback!\n\n6. **Keep Learning:** Accessibility is an evolving field. Stay up-to-date with the latest guidelines and best practices.\n\n7. **Documentation:** Document your accessibility efforts. This helps maintain consistency and demonstrates your commitment to accessibility.\n\n8. **Prioritize:** If you\u0027re working on an existing website, prioritize the most critical issues and address them first. Focus on areas that have the biggest impact on the largest number of users.\n\n9. **Not a Replacement for Expertise:** This checklist is not a substitute for professional accessibility expertise. Consider consulting with an accessibility specialist for complex projects.\n\n10. **WCAG 2.2:** Be aware that WCAG 2.2 is the latest version (as of late 2023) and includes some new success criteria. While WCAG 2.1 is still widely referenced, it\u0027s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the 2.2 updates as well.\n\nBy following this checklist and incorporating accessibility testing into your development workflow, you can create websites that are more inclusive and usable for everyone. Good luck!\n", "Grok": "Website accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with a website. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are the most widely accepted standards for web accessibility. The current version, WCAG 2.1 (as of this writing), is organized into four main principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust), with specific guidelines and success criteria at three levels: A (basic), AA (intermediate), and AAA (advanced). Most organizations aim for Level AA compliance, as it is the standard for many legal requirements.\n\nBelow is a concise **WCAG Checklist** based on WCAG 2.1 Level AA. This checklist can serve as a starting point for evaluating and improving a website\u0027s accessibility. Note that this is not exhaustive, and full compliance often requires detailed testing with assistive technologies and user feedback.\n\n---\n\n### **Principle 1: Perceivable**\nInformation and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive (e.g., through sight, sound, or touch).\n\n#### Text Alternatives (1.1)\n- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)**: Provide text alternatives (alt text) for all non-text content (images, icons, etc.) so screen readers can describe them. Ensure alt text is descriptive or uses \u0060alt=\u0022\u0022\u0060 for decorative images.\n\n#### Time-based Media (1.2)\n- **1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) (Level A)**: Provide alternatives for audio-only or video-only content (e.g., transcripts for audio, text descriptions for video).\n- **1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) (Level A)**: Include captions for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media (e.g., videos).\n- **1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level A)**: Provide audio descriptions or full text alternatives for prerecorded video content.\n- **1.2.4 Captions (Live) (Level AA)**: Include captions for live audio content in synchronized media.\n- **1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AA)**: Provide audio descriptions for prerecorded video content.\n\n#### Adaptable (1.3)\n- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**: Ensure content structure (headings, lists, tables) is programmatically determinable using proper HTML markup (e.g., \u0060\u003Ch1\u003E\u0060, \u0060\u003Ctable\u003E\u0060 with headers).\n- **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)**: Present content in a logical reading order that can be determined programmatically.\n- **1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A)**: Avoid instructions that rely solely on sensory characteristics (e.g., \u201Cclick the red button\u201D);
