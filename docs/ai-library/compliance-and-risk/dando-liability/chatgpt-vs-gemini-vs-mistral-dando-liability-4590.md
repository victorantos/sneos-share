Their responsibilities are broad and encompass several key areas:\n\n**1.

This includes assessing strategic plans, financial results, operational efficiency, and compliance with legal and ethical standards.\n*   **Risk Management:** Ensuring that the company has effective risk management systems in place and that management is adequately identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. This includes financial, operational, compliance, and reputational risks.\n*   **Internal Controls:** Monitoring the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and operations. They rely on reports from internal audit and the external auditor.\n*   **Compliance:** Overseeing the company\u0027s compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical standards.\n*   **Succession Planning:** Participating in the planning for the succession of key executives, including the CEO.  This ensures a smooth transition and minimizes disruption.\n*   **Crisis Management:**  Providing oversight and guidance during crises, ensuring the company responds effectively and ethically.\n\n**2. Strategic Guidance and Counsel:**\n\n*   **Strategic Planning:** Providing independent perspective and guidance on the company\u0027s strategic direction.

This means putting the company\u0027s interests ahead of their own personal interests.\n*   **Duty of Good Faith:**  Acting honestly and with integrity in all dealings with the company.\n\n**Independence Requirements:**\n\nTo fulfill their responsibilities effectively, independent directors must be truly independent from management.
