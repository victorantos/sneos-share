The meeting date is critical.\n*   **Subject:** A concise description of what the resolution addresses.\n*   **WHEREAS Clauses (Recitals):**\n    *   These are the \u0022whereas\u0022 clauses. They provide the background information, justification, and rationale for the resolution.  They set the stage and explain why the board is taking this action.\n    *   Use factual statements.\n    *   Explain the need for the resolution.\n    *   Refer to relevant documents or information.\n*   **RESOLVED, THAT Clauses (The Action):**\n    *   This is the core of the resolution.

Avoid vague language.\n    *   Include all necessary details (e.g., dollar amounts, names, dates, specific terms).\n    *   Break down complex actions into multiple numbered clauses for clarity.\n*   **FURTHER RESOLVED, THAT Clauses (Additional Actions/Clarifications):**\n    *   Use this section for any related actions, delegations of authority, or clarifications that stem from the main resolution.\n*   **Certification:**\n    *   This section is signed by the company secretary (or another authorized officer) to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the resolution.\n    *   It confirms that the resolution was properly adopted at a valid board meeting with a quorum present.\n*   **Approval:**\n     * This section is signed by the Chairman or Presiding Officer.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Quorum:** Ensure a quorum of directors was present at the meeting when the resolution was adopted.  The certification confirms this.\n*   **Voting:** While not always explicitly stated in the resolution itself, the minutes of the meeting should record the voting results (e.g., unanimous approval, votes for, votes against, abstentions).\n*   **Legal Review:** For significant or complex matters, have the resolution reviewed by legal counsel *before* it\u0027s adopted.\n*   **Record Keeping:**  Store all board resolutions securely and systematically.  They are important legal documents.\n*   **State Law:**  Be aware of any specific requirements for board resolutions under the laws of your state of incorporation.\n\n**Examples of Board Resolution Templates (Tailored to Specific Scenarios):**\n\n**1.
