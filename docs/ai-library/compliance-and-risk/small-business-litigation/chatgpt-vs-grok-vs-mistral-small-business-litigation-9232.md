Services like AAA or JAMS provide arbitrators, with costs varying based on the case (often $1,000\u002B per day).\n\n4. **Collaborative Law**\n - **Description**: Each party hires a lawyer trained in collaborative law, and all agree to work together to resolve the dispute without going to court.

By incorporating ADR clauses into contracts, understanding the different methods, and leveraging available resources, small businesses can avoid the high costs and stress of litigation while maintaining important relationships. If you\u0027re facing a dispute, consider starting with negotiation or mediation and escalate to arbitration only if necessary. For tailored advice, consulting a local attorney or dispute resolution professional can help navigate the process.", "Mistral": "Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) can be a valuable tool for small businesses to resolve conflicts without the cost and time commitment of traditional litigation.
