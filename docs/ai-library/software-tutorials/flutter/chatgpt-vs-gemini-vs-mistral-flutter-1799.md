  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Sure! Here\u0027s a basic tutorial to get you started with **Flutter 3.24**. Flutter is Google\u0027s UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.\n\n---\n\n## Flutter 3.24 Tutorial: Getting Started\n\n### Step 1: Install Flutter\n\n1. **Download Flutter SDK** \n Visit [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and follow the instructions to download and install Flutter SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n\n2. **Set up environment variables** \n Add the Flutter \u0060bin\u0060 directory to your system \u0060PATH\u0060.\n\n3. **Verify installation** \n Run the following in your terminal or command prompt:\n \u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n flutter doctor\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n This command checks your environment and displays a report.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Create a new Flutter project\n\nOpen your terminal and run:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nflutter create my_flutter_app\ncd my_flutter_app\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis creates a new Flutter project named \u0060my_flutter_app\u0060.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Run your app\n\nMake sure you have an emulator running or a real device connected, then run:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nflutter run\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou should see a basic Flutter app running with a counter on the screen.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Understand the default code\n\nLet\u0027s look at \u0060lib/main.dart\u0060. The default app shows a simple counter app:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060dart\nimport \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n\nvoid main() {\n runApp(const MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n const MyApp({super.key});\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n return MaterialApp(\n title: \u0027Flutter Demo\u0027,\n theme: ThemeData(\n primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n ),\n home: const MyHomePage(title: \u0027Flutter Demo Home Page\u0027),\n );\n }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});\n\n final String title;\n\n @override\n State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E createState() =\u003E _MyHomePageState();\n}\n\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E {\n int _counter = 0;\n\n void _incrementCounter() {\n setState(() {\n _counter\u002B\u002B;\n });\n }\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n return Scaffold(\n appBar: AppBar(\n title: Text(widget.title),\n ),\n body: Center(\n child: Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n const Text(\n \u0027You have pushed the button this many times:\u0027,\n ),\n Text(\n \u0027$_counter\u0027,\n style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,\n ),\n ],\n ),\n ),\n floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n tooltip: \u0027Increment\u0027,\n child: const Icon(Icons.add),\n ),\n );\n }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Modify the app (Example)\n\nChange the counter increment to add 2 instead of 1:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060dart\nvoid _incrementCounter() {\n setState(() {\n _counter \u002B= 2;\n });\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nSave and hot reload (\u0060r\u0060 in terminal or use IDE hot reload). Your app updates instantly.\n\n---\n\n### Key concepts:\n\n- **Widgets**: Everything in Flutter is a widget \u2014 buttons, text, layouts.\n- **Stateful vs Stateless Widgets**: Widgets that maintain state (\u0060StatefulWidget\u0060) vs those that don\u2019t (\u0060StatelessWidget\u0060).\n- **setState**: Tells Flutter the state has changed and rebuilds the UI.\n- **MaterialApp \u0026 Scaffold**: Basic layout components for a material design app.\n\n---\n\n### Resources:\n\n- [Official Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)\n- [Flutter YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/flutterdev)\n- [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can guide you through more advanced topics like navigation, state management, or integrating APIs in Flutter 3.24. Just ask!", "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s outline a Flutter 3.24 tutorial. I\u0027ll break it down into logical sections with examples. I\u0027ll focus on key concepts and new features while providing guidance to get you started.\n\n**Tutorial Outline: Flutter 3.24 (Beginner to Intermediate)**\n\n**I. Setting Up Your Flutter Environment (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Install Flutter SDK:**\n\n * **Download:** Go to the official Flutter website ([https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)) and follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n * **Extract:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., \u0060C:\\flutter\u0060 on Windows or \u0060~/flutter\u0060 on macOS/Linux). **Avoid spaces in the path.**\n * **Add to PATH:** Add the \u0060flutter/bin\u0060 directory to your system\u0027s PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Flutter commands from the command line.\n * **Verify Installation:** Open a new terminal or command prompt and run \u0060flutter --version\u0060. You should see the Flutter version information.\n\n2. **Install an IDE (Android Studio or VS Code):**\n\n * **Android Studio:** (Recommended, especially for Android development) Download and install from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).\n * **VS Code:** Download and install from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n3. **Install Flutter and Dart Plugins:**\n\n * **Android Studio:**\n * Go to \u0060File \u003E Settings \u003E Plugins\u0060.\n * Search for \u0022Flutter\u0022 and \u0022Dart\u0022 and install them.\n * Restart Android Studio.\n * **VS Code:**\n * Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl\u002BShift\u002BX or Cmd\u002BShift\u002BX).\n * Search for \u0022Flutter\u0022 and \u0022Dart\u0022 and install them.\n * Reload VS Code.\n\n4. **Set up an Emulator or Physical Device:**\n\n * **Android Emulator:** Android Studio provides a built-in emulator. Go to \u0060Tools \u003E Device Manager\u0060 to create and manage virtual devices. Choose a suitable Android version and device configuration.\n * **iOS Simulator:** Requires macOS and Xcode. Open Xcode and go to \u0060Xcode \u003E Open Developer Tool \u003E Simulator\u0060.\n * **Physical Device:**\n * **Android:** Enable Developer Options on your phone (usually by tapping the Build Number multiple times in Settings). Enable USB Debugging. Connect your phone to your computer.\n * **iOS:** Requires a paid Apple Developer account. Follow the instructions in the Flutter documentation for code signing and provisioning profiles.\n\n5. **Verify Setup:**\n\n * Run \u0060flutter doctor\u0060 in your terminal. This command checks your environment and identifies any missing dependencies or configuration issues. Address any problems reported by \u0060flutter doctor\u0060.\n\n**II. Creating Your First Flutter App (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Create a New Project:**\n\n * Open your terminal or command prompt.\n * Navigate to the directory where you want to store your Flutter projects (e.g., \u0060cd Documents/FlutterProjects\u0060).\n * Run \u0060flutter create my_first_app\u0060. Replace \u0060my_first_app\u0060 with your desired project name.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n * \u0060cd my_first_app\u0060\n\n3. **Run the App:**\n\n * \u0060flutter run\u0060\n * This will build and launch the app on your connected emulator or device. You should see the default Flutter demo app.\n\n**III. Understanding the Basic Structure (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **\u0060main.dart\u0060:**\n\n * This is the entry point of your Flutter app. It contains the \u0060main()\u0060 function, which is executed when the app starts.\n * Open \u0060lib/main.dart\u0060 in your IDE.\n * \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n\n void main() {\n runApp(const MyApp());\n }\n\n class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n const MyApp({super.key});\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n return MaterialApp(\n title: \u0027Flutter Demo\u0027,\n theme: ThemeData(\n colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),\n useMaterial3: true,\n ),\n home: const MyHomePage(title: \u0027Flutter Demo Home Page\u0027),\n );\n }\n }\n\n class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});\n\n final String title;\n\n @override\n State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E createState() =\u003E _MyHomePageState();\n }\n\n class _MyHomePageState extends State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E {\n int _counter = 0;\n\n void _incrementCounter() {\n setState(() {\n _counter\u002B\u002B;\n });\n }\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n return Scaffold(\n appBar: AppBar(\n backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,\n title: Text(widget.title),\n ),\n body: Center(\n child: Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n const Text(\n \u0027You have pushed the button this many times:\u0027,\n ),\n Text(\n \u0027$_counter\u0027,\n style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,\n ),\n ],\n ),\n ),\n floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n tooltip: \u0027Increment\u0027,\n child: const Icon(Icons.add),\n ),\n );\n }\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n2. **Key Concepts:**\n\n * **\u0060MaterialApp\u0060:** The root widget that configures the app\u0027s theme, title, home screen, and other global settings. It uses Material Design by default.\n * **\u0060StatelessWidget\u0060:** A widget that describes part of the user interface by building a constellation of other widgets that describe the user interface more concretely. Stateless widgets are immutable and do not have internal state. Their appearance and behavior are determined solely by their configuration.\n * **\u0060StatefulWidget\u0060:** A widget that has mutable state. \u0060StatefulWidget\u0060s are dynamic and can change their appearance and behavior based on user interaction or other events.\n * **\u0060State\u0060:** The mutable data associated with a \u0060StatefulWidget\u0060. The \u0060State\u0060 object is responsible for managing the widget\u0027s state and rebuilding the UI when the state changes.\n * **\u0060build()\u0060 method:** Every widget has a \u0060build()\u0060 method. This method returns the widget that describes the UI.\n * **\u0060Scaffold\u0060:** Provides the basic visual structure for a screen, including an \u0060AppBar\u0060, \u0060Body\u0060, and \u0060FloatingActionButton\u0060.\n * **\u0060AppBar\u0060:** A toolbar at the top of the screen.\n * **\u0060Center\u0060:** A widget that centers its child.\n * **\u0060Column\u0060:** A widget that arranges its children in a vertical column.\n * **\u0060Text\u0060:** A widget that displays text.\n * **\u0060FloatingActionButton\u0060:** A round button that floats above the content.\n\n3. **Hot Reload:**\n\n * Make a small change to the text in the \u0060Text\u0060 widget (e.g., change \u0022Flutter Demo Home Page\u0022 to \u0022My First App\u0022).\n * Save the file (Ctrl\u002BS or Cmd\u002BS).\n * You should see the app update almost instantly without restarting. This is Hot Reload.\n\n**IV. Building a Simple UI (30-45 minutes)**\n\n1. **Modify the \u0060MyHomePage\u0060 Widget:**\n\n * Replace the existing content of the \u0060body\u0060 of the \u0060Scaffold\u0060 with a more custom layout.\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n body: Center(\n child: Padding(\n padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n child: Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n const Text(\n \u0027Welcome to My First App!\u0027,\n style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n textAlign: TextAlign.center,\n ),\n const SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n // Add functionality here later\n print(\u0027Button Pressed!\u0027);\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Press Me\u0027),\n ),\n ],\n ),\n ),\n ),\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * **\u0060Padding\u0060:** Adds space around the content.\n * **\u0060Column\u0060:** Arranges the widgets vertically.\n * **\u0060Text\u0060:** Displays the welcome message with a larger font size.\n * **\u0060SizedBox\u0060:** Creates a blank space with a specific height. Useful for adding spacing between widgets.\n * **\u0060ElevatedButton\u0060:** A button with a raised appearance. The \u0060onPressed\u0060 callback is executed when the button is tapped. The \u0060child\u0060 is the widget displayed inside the button.\n\n2. **Add an Image:**\n\n * **Get an Image:** Find an image file (e.g., \u0060image.png\u0060) and place it in the \u0060assets\u0060 directory of your project. If you don\u0027t have an \u0060assets\u0060 directory, create one at the root of your project.\n * **Update \u0060pubspec.yaml\u0060:** Open \u0060pubspec.yaml\u0060 and uncomment (remove the \u0060#\u0060 from the lines) the \u0060assets:\u0060 section. Then, add the path to your image. **Indentation is critical in \u0060pubspec.yaml\u0060.**\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\n dependencies:\n flutter:\n sdk: flutter\n\n # The following section is specific to Flutter packages.\n flutter:\n\n uses-material-design: true\n\n assets:\n - assets/image.png\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Use the \u0060Image\u0060 Widget:** Add an \u0060Image\u0060 widget to your \u0060Column\u0060.\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n Image.asset(\u0027assets/image.png\u0027, width: 200, height: 200), // Add the image\n const Text(\n \u0027Welcome to My First App!\u0027,\n style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n textAlign: TextAlign.center,\n ),\n const SizedBox(height: 20),\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n print(\u0027Button Pressed!\u0027);\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Press Me\u0027),\n ),\n ],\n ),\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060Image.asset(\u0027assets/image.png\u0027)\u0060 loads the image from the \u0060assets\u0060 directory.\n * \u0060width\u0060 and \u0060height\u0060 control the size of the image.\n\n * **Important:** After modifying \u0060pubspec.yaml\u0060, save the file and run \u0060flutter pub get\u0060 in your terminal to update the project\u0027s dependencies and assets.\n\n3. **Handle Button Presses:**\n\n * Update the \u0060onPressed\u0060 callback of the \u0060ElevatedButton\u0060 to update the UI. Let\u0027s display a message.\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n setState(() {\n _message = \u0027Button was pressed!\u0027;\n });\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Press Me\u0027),\n ),\n const SizedBox(height: 20),\n Text(_message),\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * Add a \u0060_message\u0060 variable to your \u0060_MyHomePageState\u0060 class:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n class _MyHomePageState extends State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E {\n int _counter = 0;\n String _message = \u0027\u0027; // Add this line\n\n void _incrementCounter() {\n setState(() {\n _counter\u002B\u002B;\n });\n }\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n // ... rest of the code\n }\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060setState(() { ... })\u0060 tells Flutter to rebuild the UI with the updated \u0060_message\u0060 value. This is crucial for updating the UI based on user interaction.\n\n**V. Navigation (20-30 minutes)**\n\n1. **Create a Second Screen:**\n\n * Create a new Dart file named \u0060second_screen.dart\u0060 in the \u0060lib\u0060 directory.\n * Add the following code to \u0060second_screen.dart\u0060:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n\n class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n const SecondScreen({super.key, required this.message});\n\n final String message;\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n return Scaffold(\n appBar: AppBar(\n title: const Text(\u0027Second Screen\u0027),\n ),\n body: Center(\n child: Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n Text(\n message,\n style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20),\n ),\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n Navigator.pop(context); // Go back to the previous screen\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Go Back\u0027),\n ),\n ],\n ),\n ),\n );\n }\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * This creates a simple \u0060StatelessWidget\u0060 called \u0060SecondScreen\u0060 with an \u0060AppBar\u0060, a \u0060Text\u0060 widget to display a message, and a button to navigate back. It accepts a \u0060message\u0060 as a parameter.\n * \u0060Navigator.pop(context)\u0060 removes the current screen from the navigation stack, returning to the previous screen.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Second Screen:**\n\n * In \u0060main.dart\u0060, import \u0060second_screen.dart\u0060:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:my_first_app/second_screen.dart\u0027; // Import the second screen\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n\n void main() {\n runApp(const MyApp());\n }\n\n // ... rest of the MyApp and MyHomePage code\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * Modify the \u0060ElevatedButton\u0060\u0027s \u0060onPressed\u0060 in \u0060main.dart\u0060 to navigate to the second screen:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n Navigator.push(\n context,\n MaterialPageRoute(\n builder: (context) =\u003E const SecondScreen(message: \u0027Hello from the first screen!\u0027),\n ),\n );\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Go to Second Screen\u0027),\n ),\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060Navigator.push(context, route)\u0060 adds a new screen to the navigation stack.\n * \u0060MaterialPageRoute\u0060 defines the transition animation between screens (Material Design style).\n * The \u0060builder\u0060 function constructs the widget to display on the new screen (\u0060SecondScreen\u0060). We\u0027re passing a message to the \u0060SecondScreen\u0060 constructor.\n\n**VI. State Management (Introduction) (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Understanding State Management:**\n\n * As your apps grow in complexity, managing state becomes increasingly important. State refers to the data that changes within your app (e.g., user input, API responses, application settings).\n * Flutter offers several state management solutions, ranging from simple techniques like \u0060setState\u0060 to more advanced approaches like Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, and GetX.\n\n2. **Using \u0060setState\u0060 (Simple State Management):**\n\n * We\u0027ve already used \u0060setState\u0060 in the \u0060MyHomePage\u0060 example. It\u0027s suitable for simple UI updates within a single widget.\n\n3. **Introduce a Simple Provider (Example):**\n\n * Add the \u0060provider\u0060 package to your \u0060pubspec.yaml\u0060:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060yaml\n dependencies:\n flutter:\n sdk: flutter\n provider: ^6.0.0 # Or the latest version\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * Run \u0060flutter pub get\u0060 to install the package.\n\n * Create a simple \u0060CounterProvider\u0060 class:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n\n class CounterProvider with ChangeNotifier {\n int _counter = 0;\n\n int get counter =\u003E _counter;\n\n void incrementCounter() {\n _counter\u002B\u002B;\n notifyListeners(); // Important: Notify listeners of the change\n }\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060ChangeNotifier\u0060 is a class that provides a way to notify listeners when its data changes.\n * \u0060_counter\u0060 is the internal counter value.\n * \u0060counter\u0060 is a getter that allows access to the counter value.\n * \u0060incrementCounter\u0060 increments the counter and calls \u0060notifyListeners()\u0060 to update the UI.\n\n * Wrap your \u0060MyApp\u0060 with a \u0060ChangeNotifierProvider\u0060:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n import \u0027package:provider/provider.dart\u0027; // Import the provider package\n import \u0027package:my_first_app/counter_provider.dart\u0027; // Import the CounterProvider\n\n void main() {\n runApp(\n ChangeNotifierProvider(\n create: (context) =\u003E CounterProvider(),\n child: const MyApp(),\n ),\n );\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060ChangeNotifierProvider\u0060 makes the \u0060CounterProvider\u0060 available to all widgets in its subtree.\n * \u0060create: (context) =\u003E CounterProvider()\u0060 creates an instance of the \u0060CounterProvider\u0060.\n * \u0060child: const MyApp()\u0060 is the widget that receives the provider.\n\n * Use the \u0060CounterProvider\u0060 in your \u0060MyHomePage\u0060:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060dart\n import \u0027package:flutter/material.dart\u0027;\n import \u0027package:provider/provider.dart\u0027; // Import the provider package\n import \u0027package:my_first_app/counter_provider.dart\u0027;\n\n class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});\n\n final String title;\n\n @override\n State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E createState() =\u003E _MyHomePageState();\n }\n\n class _MyHomePageState extends State\u003CMyHomePage\u003E {\n String _message = \u0027\u0027; // Add this line\n\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n final counterProvider = Provider.of\u003CCounterProvider\u003E(context); // Get the provider\n\n return Scaffold(\n appBar: AppBar(\n backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,\n title: Text(widget.title),\n ),\n body: Center(\n child: Padding(\n padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n child: Column(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n children: \u003CWidget\u003E[\n const Text(\n \u0027Welcome to My First App!\u0027,\n style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n textAlign: TextAlign.center,\n ),\n const SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n Navigator.push(\n context,\n MaterialPageRoute(\n builder: (context) =\u003E const SecondScreen(message: \u0027Hello from the first screen!\u0027),\n ),\n );\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Go to Second Screen\u0027),\n ),\n ElevatedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n setState(() {\n _message = \u0027Button was pressed!\u0027;\n });\n },\n child: const Text(\u0027Press Me\u0027),\n ),\n const SizedBox(height: 20),\n Text(_message),\n Text(\n \u0027Counter: ${counterProvider.counter}\u0027, // Display the counter\n style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,\n ),\n ],\n ),\n ),\n ),\n floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n onPressed: () {\n counterProvider.incrementCounter(); // Increment the counter\n },\n tooltip: \u0027Increment\u0027,\n child: const Icon(Icons.add),\n ),\n );\n }\n }\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n * **Explanation:**\n * \u0060Provider.of\u003CCounterProvider\u003E(context)\u0060 retrieves the \u0060CounterProvider\u0060 instance from the widget tree.\n * \u0060counterProvider.counter\u0060 accesses the current counter value.\n * \u0060counterProvider.incrementCounter()\u0060 calls the method to increment the counter.\n * The \u0060Text\u0060 widget now displays the value from the \u0060CounterProvider\u0060.\n\n**VII. Introduction to Flutter 3.24 Features (10-15 minutes)**\n\nFlutter 3.24 is a very new release (as of the generation of this answer).
