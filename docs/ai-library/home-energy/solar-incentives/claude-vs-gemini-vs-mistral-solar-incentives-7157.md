  :responses='{"Claude": "Here\u0027s an overview of major solar incentives by state for 2025. Note that incentive programs can change frequently, so always verify current details with state agencies and utilities:\n\n## States with Strong Solar Incentives\n\n**California**\n- Net metering (NEM 3.0 for new installations)\n- Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) for battery storage\n- Property tax exemption for solar systems\n- Various utility rebates\n\n**New York**\n- NY-Sun incentive program\n- Net metering\n- Property tax exemption (20 years)\n- Accelerated depreciation for businesses\n\n**Massachusetts**\n- SMART program (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target)\n- Net metering\n- Property tax exemption\n- Sales tax exemption\n\n**New Jersey**\n- Successor Solar Incentive (SuSI) program\n- Net metering\n- Property tax exemption\n- Sales tax exemption\n\n**Connecticut**\n- Residential Solar Investment Program (RSIP)\n- Net metering\n- Property tax exemption\n\n## Federal Incentives (Available Nationwide)\n- 30% Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) through 2032\n- USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Many states offer net metering policies\n- Utility-specific rebates vary significantly\n- Some programs have caps or may end when funding is exhausted\n- Installation requirements and eligibility criteria vary\n\nWould you like detailed information about specific states or types of incentives?", "Gemini": "It\u0027s tough to give a definitive list of solar incentives by state for 2025 right now. Solar incentives are constantly changing, and predicting what will be in place that far in advance is challenging. The best way to find out the most up-to-date information is to wait until 2025 and consult sources that are updated regularly. \n\nHowever, I can give you an overview of the *types* of incentives that are commonly available and some sources to monitor as we get closer to 2025.\n\n**Common Types of Solar Incentives:**\n\n* **Federal Tax Credit (Investment Tax Credit - ITC):** This is a federal incentive that significantly reduces the upfront cost of solar. As of now (late 2023), the ITC is at 30% for systems placed in service through 2032. It then decreases to 26% for systems placed in service in 2033 and 22% for systems placed in service in 2034. It\u0027s always possible that this could change with new legislation.\n* **State Tax Credits:** Many states offer their own tax credits in addition to the federal ITC. The amount and eligibility requirements vary greatly.\n* **Rebates:** These are direct cash payments or discounts offered by state governments, utilities, or other organizations.\n* **Net Metering:** This allows homeowners to receive credit on their electricity bill for excess solar energy they send back to the grid. The rules and rates for net metering vary widely by state and utility. Some states are moving towards \u0022net billing\u0022 or \u0022value of solar\u0022 tariffs, which may calculate the value of exported energy differently.\n* **Property Tax Exemptions:** Some states exempt solar energy systems from property taxes, preventing your property tax bill from increasing due to the added value of the solar panels.\n* **Sales Tax Exemptions:** Similar to property tax exemptions, these exempt solar energy systems from sales tax.\n* **Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs):** In some states with Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), homeowners can earn SRECs for the electricity their solar panels generate. These SRECs can then be sold on the market.\n* **Grants:** Some states or local governments offer grants for solar installations, particularly for low-income households or specific types of projects.\n* **Loan Programs:** States may offer low-interest loan programs to help homeowners finance solar installations.\n\n**Where to Find Information Closer to 2025:**\n\n* **DSIRE (Database of State Incentives for Renewables \u0026 Efficiency):** This is the most comprehensive and reliable source for information on state and federal solar incentives. It\u0027s constantly updated.\n * Website: [https://www.dsireusa.org/](https://www.dsireusa.org/)\n* **Energy Sage:** This website provides information on solar energy and allows you to get quotes from local installers. They often have summaries of incentives by state.\n * Website: [https://www.energysage.com/](https://www.energysage.com/)\n* **Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA):** SEIA is the leading trade association for the solar industry. Their website has information on solar policy and state-specific data.\n * Website: [https://www.seia.org/](https://www.seia.org/)\n* **Your State\u0027s Energy Office or Public Utility Commission:** These government agencies will have the most up-to-date information on state-specific incentives and regulations.\n* **Local Solar Installers:** Reputable solar installers will be knowledgeable about the incentives available in your area.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Incentive Availability:** Incentives can be limited in funding and may expire, so it\u0027s important to apply for them as soon as possible.\n* **Eligibility Requirements:** Each incentive will have specific eligibility requirements, such as income limits, system size restrictions, or equipment certifications.\n* **Professional Advice:** Consult with a qualified solar installer or financial advisor to determine which incentives are best suited for your situation.\n\n**In summary:** Check DSIRE, Energy Sage, SEIA, and your state\u0027s energy office closer to 2025 for the most accurate information. The specifics will depend on the evolving policy landscape. Good luck!\n", "Mistral": "As of my last update in October 2023, specific solar incentives for the year 2025 can vary significantly by state.
