This protocol is structured to address your specific requests (1\u20137). It is fictional and for illustrative purposes only\u2014not for actual use without regulatory approval (e.g., from FDA or EMA) and ethical review (e.g., IRB). In a real scenario, consult experts, legal advisors, and regulatory bodies.\n\n---\n\n# Phase II Clinical Trial Protocol: NeoVax-T Immunotherapy for Advanced Melanoma\n\n## 1. Study Design\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of NeoVax-T in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapies (e.g., PD-1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab).\n\n- **Randomization**: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control arm using stratified block randomization to balance key prognostic factors (e.g., BRAF mutation status, baseline LDH levels, and prior PD-1 therapy response). Randomization will be performed centrally via an interactive web-response system (IWRS) to ensure allocation concealment.\n- **Blinding**: Double-blind design where patients, investigators, and outcome assessors are blinded to treatment assignment. Unblinding will occur only for safety reasons or at study end.\n- **Duration**: Treatment phase up to 24 months or disease progression; follow-up for overall survival up to 5 years.\n- **Sample Size**: 200 patients total (100 per arm) across 10\u201315 sites in the US and Europe.\n- **Objectives**: Primary: Assess clinical efficacy. Secondary: Evaluate immunological responses, safety, and quality of life. Exploratory: Biomarker correlates of response.\n- **Study Timeline**: Recruitment: 18 months; Treatment/Follow-up: 3\u20135 years.\n\n## 2.

Intervention and Control Conditions\n- **Intervention Arm (NeoVax-T)**: Personalized neoantigen vaccine administered as 12 intradermal injections (0.5 mL each, with adjuvant QS-21) over 6 months (weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44; boosters at 12 and 18 months if stable). Dose: 100\u2013300 \u03BCg total peptide per injection, based on patient-specific neoantigens identified via tumor sequencing. Administered with optional concurrent low-dose cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m\u00B2 orally day -1) to reduce regulatory T-cells. No concurrent anticancer therapy except supportive care.\n- **Control Arm (Placebo)**: Matching intradermal injections of saline vehicle with adjuvant, on the same schedule, to maintain blinding. No cyclophosphamide.\n- **Administration**: Injections in the thigh by trained personnel; post-injection observation for 30 minutes. Compliance monitored via patient diaries and IWRS.\n- **Discontinuation**: At disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, or study end. Crossover to active therapy not allowed in Phase II.\n\n## 4. Primary and Secondary Outcomes with Measures\n### Primary Outcome\n- **Progression-Free Survival (PFS)**: Time from randomization to disease progression (per blinded independent central review using RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause. Measured via CT/MRI scans every 8 weeks for first 6 months, then every 12 weeks.\n\n### Secondary Outcomes\n- **Overall Survival (OS)**: Time from randomization to death from any cause. Measured via vital status checks every 3 months post-treatment.\n- **Objective Response Rate (ORR)**: Proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1.\n- **Immune Response**: Neoantigen-specific T-cell responses measured by ELISPOT assay for IFN-\u03B3 production in peripheral blood at baseline, week 12, and week 24. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density via IHC on optional on-treatment biopsies.\n- **Safety and Tolerability**: Incidence/severity of adverse events (AEs) per CTCAE v5.0.\n- **Quality of Life (QoL)**: Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 and melanoma-specific module (QLQ-MEL) scores, assessed every 12 weeks.\n\n## 5. Statistical Analysis\n- **Analysis Populations**: Intent-to-treat (ITT) for efficacy; safety population (all treated patients) for AEs.\n- **Sample Size Justification**: Based on PFS as primary endpoint. Assuming 6-month PFS of 40% in intervention vs. 20% in control (HR=0.58), 90% power, 2-sided \u03B1=0.05 (log-rank test), with 20% dropout and 12-month accrual, requires 200 patients (100/arm). Powered to detect \u226515% absolute improvement in ORR.\n- **Primary Analysis**: Cox proportional hazards model for PFS (stratified by randomization factors); Kaplan-Meier curves with 95% CI. Interim efficacy analysis at 50% events (Futility: O\u0027Brien-Fleming boundaries; Efficacy: \u03B1=0.025).\n- **Secondary Analyses**: ORR via Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test; OS via log-rank; Immune responses via mixed-effects models. QoL via linear mixed models. Multiplicity adjusted via hierarchical testing.\n- **Interim Analyses**: Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMC) reviews at 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected events for futility/efficacy (Lan-DeMets \u03B1-spending function) and safety.\n- **Software**: SAS v9.4 or R; missing data handled via multiple imputation if \u003E5%.\n\n## 6. Safety Monitoring and Adverse Events\n- **Monitoring**: All AEs/SAEs reported from informed consent through 30 days post-last dose (90 days for immune-related AEs). Ongoing via site reports to sponsor weekly; DSMC quarterly reviews.\n- **Adverse Events**: Graded per CTCAE v5.0. Expected AEs: Injection-site reactions (Grade 1\u20132), flu-like symptoms, fatigue. Immune-related AEs (irAEs, e.g., colitis, pneumonitis) monitored with labs (e.g., thyroid function every 4 weeks) and specialist referrals.\n- **Dose Modifications**: Delay/reduce for Grade \u22653 non-hematologic AEs or Grade \u22652 held until resolution. Permanent discontinuation for life-threatening AEs or Grade 4 irAEs.\n- **Safety Oversight**: Independent DSMC with authority to recommend pausing/enrollment halt. Report SAEs to IRB/DSMC within 24 hours; annual safety updates to regulators. Pregnancy reporting mandatory.\n- **Stopping Rules**: Interim halt if \u003E20% Grade 3/4 irAEs attributable to treatment or excess mortality (per DSMC).\n\n## 7.
