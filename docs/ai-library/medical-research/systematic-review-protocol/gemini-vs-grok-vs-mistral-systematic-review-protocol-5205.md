  :responses='{"Gemini": "This systematic review protocol is designed to provide a comprehensive and transparent plan for evaluating the effectiveness of telemedicine in diabetes management. Following these steps will ensure rigor and reduce bias in the review process.\n\n---\n\n## Systematic Review Protocol: Effectiveness of Telemedicine for Diabetes Management\n\n**Protocol Registration:** This protocol will be registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) prior to commencing the systematic review process (i.e., before screening studies). The registration number will be included here once obtained.\n\n**Review Team:**\n*   [Your Name/Team Member 1]\n*   [Your Name/Team Member 2]\n*   [Your Name/Team Member 3 - if applicable, e.g., for arbitration]\n\n**Date of Protocol Development:** [Current Date]\n\n---\n\n### 1. Introduction and Background\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide, leading to severe complications if not properly managed. Effective management typically involves regular monitoring of blood glucose, medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and frequent interactions with healthcare providers. Telemedicine, which utilizes telecommunication technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, offers a promising approach to enhance diabetes management, improve access to care, and potentially reduce healthcare costs. This systematic review aims to synthesize the current evidence on the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions for adults with diabetes.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions compared to standard care or alternative telemedicine modalities in improving clinical, behavioral, and patient-reported outcomes in adults with diabetes.\n\n---\n\n### 2. PICO Question Formulation\n\n**PICO Question:**\nIn **P**opulation (adults with diagnosed diabetes \u2013 Type 1, Type 2, or gestational diabetes), what is the effectiveness of **I**ntervention (telemedicine interventions, e.g., remote monitoring, virtual consultations, mobile health apps, web-based platforms, tele-coaching, or a combination) compared to **C**omparison (standard diabetes care \u2013 e.g., face-to-face consultations, routine self-management education without telemedicine components \u2013 or alternative telemedicine modalities), on **O**utcomes (including glycemic control [HbA1c], blood pressure, lipid profiles, weight management, diabetes-related complications, healthcare utilization, quality of life, and patient satisfaction)?\n\n**Breakdown:**\n*   **P (Population):** Adults (\u226518 years) with diagnosed diabetes (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, or Gestational Diabetes Mellitus).\n*   **I (Intervention):** Telemedicine interventions, broadly defined to include technologies and services that deliver healthcare remotely. Examples include:\n    *   Remote monitoring (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring [CGM] data transmitted remotely, blood pressure monitoring, weight scales).\n    *   Virtual consultations (e.g., video calls, secure messaging with healthcare providers).\n    *   Mobile health (mHealth) applications (e.g., apps for self-management, medication reminders, diet tracking).\n    *   Web-based platforms (e.g., patient portals, online educational modules).\n    *   Tele-coaching or tele-education (e.g., remote health coaching, group education sessions via video conference).\n    *   Phone calls (structured interventions beyond routine check-ups).\n    *   Hybrid models combining several of these.\n*   **C (Comparison):**\n    *   Standard/usual diabetes care (e.g., routine face-to-face consultations, conventional self-management education, usual care without specific telemedicine components).\n    *   Another telemedicine modality (e.g., comparing an app-based intervention to a video-consultation intervention).\n*   **O (Outcomes):**\n    *   **Primary Outcome:**\n        *   Glycemic control (e.g., Glycated Hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] levels).\n    *   **Secondary Outcomes:**\n        *   Cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides).\n        *   Anthropometric measures (e.g., body weight, BMI).\n        *   Diabetes-related complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular events, amputations, hypoglycemia incidence).\n        *   Healthcare utilization (e.g., emergency department visits, hospitalizations, primary care visits, medication changes).\n        *   Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as:\n            *   Quality of life (QoL).\n            *   Patient satisfaction with care.\n            *   Self-efficacy/self-management behaviors.\n            *   Diabetes distress.\n        *   Cost-effectiveness (if reported).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Comprehensive Search Strategy\n\nThe search strategy will be developed systematically using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms for PubMed, Emtree terms for Embase). It will be adapted for each database\u0027s specific syntax.\n\n**Databases to be searched:**\n1.  **PubMed (MEDLINE)**\n2.  **Embase**\n3.  **Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) within The Cochrane Library**\n4.  **CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature)**\n5.  **Web of Science (Core Collection)**\n6.  **Scopus**\n\n**Search Filters/Limits:**\n*   Human studies only.\n*   English language only.\n*   No date restrictions (to capture all available evidence).\n*   Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) will be prioritized using specific study type filters where available (e.g., \u0022randomized controlled trial\u0022 as a publication type or MeSH term).\n\n**Key Search Concepts and Example Terms (PubMed format):**\n\n1.  **Population (Diabetes):**\n    *   \u0060\u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Gestational Diabetes\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060diabetes[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060diabetic[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060T1DM[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060T2DM[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060GDM[tiab]\u0060\n\n2.  **Intervention (Telemedicine):**\n    *   \u0060\u0022Telemedicine\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Telehealth\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Mobile Applications\u0022[Mesh]\u0060 OR \u0060telemedicine[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060telehealth[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060eHealth[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060mHealth[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060mobile health[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060remote monitoring[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060virtual consultation[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060teleconsultation[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060telecoaching[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060web-based[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060internet-based[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060mobile app[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060app[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060digital health[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060remote care[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060connected health[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060tele-education[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060videoconference[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060SMS[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060text message[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060wearable device[tiab]\u0060\n\n3.  **Study Design (RCTs):**\n    *   \u0060\u0022Randomized Controlled Trial\u0022[pt]\u0060 OR \u0060\u0022Controlled Clinical Trial\u0022[pt]\u0060 OR \u0060randomized[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060randomised[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060RCT[tiab]\u0060 OR \u0060trial[tiab]\u0060\n\n**Combined Search String Example (PubMed):**\n\n\u0060( (\u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Gestational Diabetes\u0022[Mesh] OR diabetes[tiab] OR diabetic[tiab] OR T1DM[tiab] OR T2DM[tiab] OR GDM[tiab]) )\u0060\n\u0060AND\u0060\n\u0060( (\u0022Telemedicine\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Telehealth\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022Mobile Applications\u0022[Mesh] OR telemedicine[tiab] OR telehealth[tiab] OR eHealth[tiab] OR mHealth[tiab] OR \u0022mobile health\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022remote monitoring\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022virtual consultation\u0022[tiab] OR teleconsultation[tiab] OR telecoaching[tiab] OR \u0022web-based\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022internet-based\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022mobile app\u0022[tiab] OR app[tiab] OR \u0022digital health\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022remote care\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022connected health\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022tele-education\u0022[tiab] OR videoconference[tiab] OR SMS[tiab] OR \u0022text message\u0022[tiab] OR \u0022wearable device\u0022[tiab]) )\u0060\n\u0060AND\u0060\n\u0060( (\u0022Randomized Controlled Trial\u0022[pt] OR \u0022Controlled Clinical Trial\u0022[pt] OR randomized[tiab] OR randomised[tiab] OR RCT[tiab] OR trial[tiab]) )\u0060\n\n**Additional Search Methods:**\n*   Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews will be screened for additional eligible studies.\n*   Key journals in the field (e.g., Diabetes Care, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Telemedicine and e-Health) will be hand-searched if initial searches yield limited results.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\n**Types of Studies:**\n*   **Included:** Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).\n*   **Excluded:** Quasi-RCTs, non-randomized studies (e.g., cohort studies, case-control studies, observational studies, qualitative studies), reviews, editorials, commentaries, conference abstracts without full text, protocols without results, animal studies, in vitro studies.\n\n**Types of Participants:**\n*   **Included:** Adults (\u226518 years old) with a formal diagnosis of any type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational diabetes).\n*   **Excluded:** Children/adolescents (\u003C18 years), individuals without a diabetes diagnosis, healthy volunteers, participants with only pre-diabetes.\n\n**Types of Interventions:**\n*   **Included:** Telemedicine interventions (as broadly defined in the PICO question, e.g., remote monitoring, virtual consultations, mobile health apps, web-based platforms, tele-coaching, or a combination). The intervention must have a clear telemedicine component aimed at diabetes management.\n*   **Excluded:** Interventions primarily focused on general health promotion without specific diabetes management, face-to-face interventions only, or interventions where the telemedicine component is not clearly described or is negligible.\n\n**Types of Comparators:**\n*   **Included:** Standard/usual diabetes care (e.g., routine face-to-face consultations, conventional self-management education, usual care without specific telemedicine components) OR alternative telemedicine modalities.\n*   **Excluded:** No comparison group (e.g., uncontrolled before-and-after studies).\n\n**Types of Outcomes:**\n*   **Included:** Studies reporting at least one primary outcome (HbA1c) or any of the specified secondary outcomes.\n*   **Excluded:** Studies that only report process measures (e.g., number of logins) without clinical or patient-reported outcomes.\n\n**Language:** English only.\n\n**Publication Status:** Peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Study Selection Process\n\n1.  **De-duplication:** All search results will be imported into a reference management software (e.g., EndNote, Zotero, Rayyan) and duplicates will be removed.\n2.  **Title and Abstract Screening:** Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of all identified records against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Records clearly not meeting the criteria will be excluded. Any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion between the two reviewers or, if necessary, by a third reviewer.\n3.  **Full-Text Screening:** The full text of potentially eligible articles will be retrieved. Two independent reviewers will then critically assess these articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage will be recorded. Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer.\n4.  **Reporting:** A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram will be used to illustrate the study selection process.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Quality Assessment (Risk of Bias)\n\nThe methodological quality and risk of bias of all included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) will be independently assessed by two reviewers using the **Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2.0)**.\n\n**RoB 2.0 Domains:**\nThe tool assesses bias across five domains:\n1.  Bias arising from the randomization process.\n2.  Bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention).\n3.  Bias due to missing outcome data.\n4.  Bias in measurement of the outcome.\n5.  Bias in selection of the reported result.\n\n**Assessment Process:**\n*   For each domain, studies will be categorized as \u0022low risk of bias,\u0022 \u0022some concerns,\u0022 or \u0022high risk of bias.\u0022\n*   Discrepancies between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or, if consensus cannot be reached, by a third reviewer.\n*   The results of the risk of bias assessment will be presented in tables and graphs within the review and will be considered during data synthesis and interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Data Extraction and Synthesis\n\n**Data Extraction:**\nA standardized, pre-piloted data extraction form will be used to extract relevant information from the included studies. Two independent reviewers will extract data, and discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer.\nThe following data will be extracted:\n\n*   **Study Characteristics:** Author(s), year of publication, country, study design, funding source, duration of intervention and follow-up.\n*   **Participant Characteristics:** Total number of participants, age (mean/SD), gender distribution, type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, GDM), duration of diabetes, baseline HbA1c, comorbidities, inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n*   **Intervention Details:** Specific type of telemedicine intervention (e.g., app, video, remote monitoring), components (e.g., education, feedback, coaching), frequency and duration of interaction, personnel involved, technology used.\n*   **Comparator Details:** Description of standard care or alternative telemedicine intervention.\n*   **Outcome Data:**\n    *   For continuous outcomes (e.g., HbA1c, blood pressure, weight): Mean and standard deviation (or median and interquartile range) at baseline and end-of-intervention/follow-up, or mean change from baseline for both intervention and control groups.\n    *   For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., incidence of complications): Number of events and total participants in each group.\n    *   Time points of outcome assessment.\n    *   Measures of effect (if reported by study, e.g., confidence intervals).\n*   **Risk of Bias Assessment:** Summary of RoB 2.0 findings for each study.\n\n**Data Synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Qualitative (Narrative) Synthesis:**\n    *   If meta-analysis is not appropriate due to substantial clinical or methodological heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. This will involve describing the characteristics of included studies, interventions, populations, and outcomes, highlighting similarities and differences.\n    *   The narrative will systematically group studies based on key characteristics (e.g., type of telemedicine, type of diabetes, duration of intervention) to identify patterns and potential explanations for observed effects.\n\n2.  **Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-analysis):**\n    *   If studies are sufficiently homogeneous in terms of PICO elements and outcome measures, a meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan (Review Manager) software or R statistical software.\n    *   **Measures of Effect:**\n        *   For continuous outcomes (e.g., HbA1c, blood pressure, weight): Mean Difference (MD) or Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MD will be used when outcomes are measured on the same scale; SMD will be used when outcomes are measured on different scales.\n        *   For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., complications, hospitalizations): Risk Ratios (RR) or Odds Ratios (OR) will be calculated with 95% CI.\n    *   **Heterogeneity:** Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I\u00B2 statistic (quantifying the proportion of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance) and the Chi-squared test (with p \u003C 0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity).\n        *   If I\u00B2 \u003C 40%, heterogeneity is considered low, and a fixed-effect model may be used.\n        *   If I\u00B2 \u2265 40%, heterogeneity is considered substantial, and a random-effects model will be used, as it accounts for both within-study and between-study variance.\n    *   **Subgroup Analysis:** If sufficient data are available, subgroup analyses will be conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity based on:\n        *   Type of diabetes (Type 1 vs. Type 2 vs. Gestational).\n        *   Specific telemedicine modality (e.g., app-based vs. video consultations vs. remote monitoring).\n        *   Duration of intervention (\u003C6 months vs. 6-12 months vs. \u003E12 months).\n        *   Baseline HbA1c levels (e.g., controlled vs. uncontrolled).\n        *   Geographic region/healthcare setting.\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** To assess the robustness of the findings, sensitivity analyses will be performed by:\n        *   Excluding studies with high risk of bias.\n        *   Excluding studies with small sample sizes.\n        *   Excluding studies funded by industry.\n    *   **Publication Bias:** Funnel plots and Egger\u0027s test (if there are at least 10 studies in a meta-analysis) will be used to assess potential publication bias.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Registration on PROSPERO\n\nThis protocol will be registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) prior to the commencement of screening studies. The registration number will be obtained and included in the final review. Registering the protocol ensures transparency, reduces duplication of efforts, and allows for public access to the planned review methodology. Any significant deviations from this protocol will be documented and justified in the final systematic review report.\n\n---\n\n**Reporting Guidelines:**\nThis systematic review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting.\n\n---", "Grok": "Below is a structured design for a systematic review protocol on the effectiveness of telemedicine for diabetes management. This follows standard guidelines (e.g., PRISMA-P for protocols) to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and rigor. I\u0027ve addressed each of your requested elements step by step.\n\n### 1. PICO Question Formulation\nThe PICO framework helps define the review\u0027s scope clearly and precisely. Based on the topic, here\u0027s a formulated question:\n\n- **Population (P)**: Adults (aged 18 years or older) diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed in community or outpatient settings (excluding pediatric populations, pregnant women, or inpatient hospital settings to focus on chronic outpatient management).\n- **Intervention (I)**: Telemedicine interventions, defined as remote delivery of diabetes care using digital technologies (e.g., teleconsultations, remote monitoring of glucose levels via apps/devices, virtual education sessions, or integrated telehealth platforms). This includes synchronous (real-time video/audio) or asynchronous (store-and-forward) modalities.\n- **Comparison (C)**: Standard in-person diabetes care (e.g., usual clinic visits, face-to-face consultations) or no telemedicine intervention. If no direct comparison, studies with pre-post designs may be considered for exploratory analysis.\n- **Outcome (O)**: Primary: Glycemic control (measured by HbA1c levels, with a clinically meaningful change of \u22650.5% reduction). Secondary: Patient-reported outcomes (e.g., quality of life via SF-36 or EQ-5D), adherence to self-management (e.g., medication or diet compliance), healthcare utilization (e.g., hospitalizations, emergency visits), and adverse events (e.g., hypoglycemia incidence).\n\n**Overall PICO Question**: In adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (P), does telemedicine (I) compared to standard in-person care (C) improve glycemic control (HbA1c) and other clinical outcomes (O)?\n\nThis question is specific yet broad enough to capture relevant evidence while allowing for subgroup analyses (e.g., by diabetes type, telemedicine modality, or follow-up duration \u22656 months).\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Search Strategy\nThe search will be comprehensive, systematic, and peer-reviewed (e.g., via a librarian) to minimize bias and ensure coverage of biomedical literature. Databases include PubMed (for broad biomedical coverage), Embase (for international and pharmacological focus), Cochrane Library (for high-quality reviews and trials), and CINAHL (for nursing and allied health perspectives on chronic care). No language restrictions initially, but non-English studies will be translated if feasible; date range: January 2000 to present (to capture the rise of digital health post-early 2000s).\n\n- **Search Components**:\n  - **Terms for Population**: \u0022diabetes mellitus\u0022 OR \u0022type 1 diabetes\u0022 OR \u0022type 2 diabetes\u0022 OR \u0022diabetic patient*\u0022.\n  - **Terms for Intervention**: \u0022telemedicine\u0022 OR \u0022telehealth\u0022 OR \u0022telediabetes\u0022 OR \u0022remote monitoring\u0022 OR \u0022virtual consultation*\u0022 OR \u0022e-health\u0022 OR \u0022m-health\u0022 OR \u0022mobile health\u0022 OR \u0022teleconsultation\u0022 OR \u0022video consult*\u0022 OR \u0022telemonitoring\u0022 OR \u0022remote glucose monitoring\u0022.\n  - **Terms for Comparison/Outcome**: No explicit terms needed for comparison; for outcomes, include \u0022HbA1c\u0022 OR \u0022glycemic control\u0022 OR \u0022blood glucose\u0022 OR \u0022diabetes management\u0022 OR \u0022self-management\u0022 OR \u0022adherence\u0022 OR \u0022quality of life\u0022 OR \u0022hospitalization*\u0022.\n  - Combine with Boolean operators: (Population terms) AND (Intervention terms) AND (Outcome terms). Use MeSH/Emtree subject headings (e.g., MeSH: \u0022Telemedicine\u0022, \u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u0022; Emtree: \u0022telemedicine\u0022, \u0022diabetes mellitus\u0022) and free-text synonyms with truncation (e.g., consult*).\n\n- **Database-Specific Strategies** (examples; full syntax to be adapted in each database):\n  - **PubMed**: (\u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u0022[Mesh] OR diabetes*) AND (\u0022Telemedicine\u0022[Mesh] OR telehealth* OR telerne*) AND (\u0022Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated\u0022[Mesh] OR \u0022glycemic control\u0022 OR HbA1c) NOT \u0022child\u0022[Mesh] Filters: Humans, English (initially).\n  - **Embase**: (\u0027diabetes mellitus\u0027/exp OR diabet*) AND (\u0027telemedicine\u0027/exp OR telehealth* OR remote monitor*) AND (\u0027glycosylated hemoglobin\u0027/exp OR \u0027glycemic control\u0027 OR hba1c) NOT \u0027child\u0027/exp.\n  - **Cochrane Library**: Search within Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL: #1 diabetes; #2 telemedicine OR telehealth OR remote; #3 #1 AND #2 (limit to trials).\n  - **CINAHL**: (MH \u0022Diabetes Mellitus\u002B\u0022) OR diabet* AND (MH \u0022Telehealth\u0022 OR MH \u0022Telenursing\u0022 OR tele*) AND (MH \u0022Hemoglobin A1C\u0022 OR glycemic OR HbA1c).\n\n- **Additional Sources**: Gray literature (e.g., Google Scholar, WHO trials registry, clinicaltrials.gov); hand-searching reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews; forward citation tracking via Scopus or Web of Science. Total expected yield: 1,000\u20132,000 records, deduplicated using EndNote or Covidence software.\n\n- **Search Execution**: Two reviewers independently run searches; update search before final analysis if \u003E12 months from protocol.\n\n### 3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nCriteria will be applied at title/abstract and full-text stages by two independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Use a priori definitions to ensure consistency.\n\n- **Inclusion Criteria**:\n  - Study Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies (e.g., controlled before-after) evaluating effectiveness; systematic reviews for reference mining but not for synthesis.\n  - Population: Matches PICO (adults with type 1/2 diabetes; \u226550% diabetes patients if mixed cohorts).\n  - Intervention: Clearly defined telemedicine as primary intervention, with \u22653 months follow-up.\n  - Comparison: Standard care or waitlist/no intervention.\n  - Outcomes: Reports at least one primary (HbA1c) or secondary outcome.\n  - Publication: Peer-reviewed, 2000\u2013present; any language.\n\n- **Exclusion Criteria**:\n  - Study Design: Observational (e.g., cohort, case-control without control group), case reports, qualitative studies, or protocols without results.\n  - Population: \u003C18 years, gestational diabetes, non-diabetes chronic conditions only, or inpatient/acute care focus.\n  - Intervention: Non-telemedicine (e.g., only in-person apps or SMS without remote clinician interaction); combined interventions where telemedicine \u003C50% of focus.\n  - Outcomes: No quantitative data on PICO outcomes; only cost-effectiveness (to be addressed in a separate economic review if needed).\n  - Other: Animal studies, duplicates, or retracted publications.\n\nExpected number of included studies: 20\u201350, based on prior scoping.\n\n### 4. Quality Assessment Tool\nGiven the focus on effectiveness and likely predominance of RCTs, the **Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) tool** will be used for primary assessment. This is the gold standard for RCTs, evaluating five domains: (1) bias from randomization, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) outcome measurement, and (5) selection of reported results. Each study receives an overall risk judgment (low, some concerns, high).\n\n- **Application**: Two reviewers independently assess each included study using the RoB 2.0 Excel template from Cochrane. Disagreements resolved by consensus or third reviewer. For non-RCTs (if any), supplement with ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions).\n- **Thresholds for Synthesis**: Studies with high RoB will be sensitivity-tested (e.g., excluded in meta-analysis) but included in narrative synthesis.\n- **Other Considerations**: Publication bias assessed via funnel plots/Egger\u0027s test if \u226510 studies; heterogeneity via I\u00B2 statistic.\n\n### 5. Plan for Data Extraction and Synthesis\nData extraction and synthesis will be rigorous, using standardized tools to ensure reliability.\n\n- **Data Extraction**:\n  - Two independent reviewers extract data using a piloted form (e.g., in Covidence or Excel), covering: study characteristics (author, year, design, sample size, setting); participant details (age, diabetes type, baseline HbA1c); intervention details (modality, frequency, duration); comparison; outcomes (means/SDs for HbA1c, secondary measures at 3\u20136 and \u226512 months); funding sources; and risks of bias.\n  - For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., hypoglycemia events), extract odds ratios (OR) or risk ratios (RR); for continuous (e.g., HbA1c), mean differences (MD) or standardized MD (SMD).\n  - Contact authors for missing data (e.g., up to two attempts via email).\n\n- **Data Synthesis**:\n  - **Narrative Synthesis**: If heterogeneity precludes meta-analysis (e.g., I\u00B2 \u003E50% or diverse interventions), summarize findings thematically (e.g., by outcome, subgroup: type 1 vs. 2 diabetes, synchronous vs. asynchronous telemedicine) using harvest plots or summary of findings table (GRADE approach for evidence quality: high/moderate/low/very low based on RoB, inconsistency, imprecision, etc.).\n  - **Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)**: If \u22653 homogeneous studies, use random-effects model in RevMan 5.4 or R (meta package). Primary analysis: MD for HbA1c change; subgroup by follow-up duration and intervention type. Forest plots for visualization; 95% CIs reported. Assess heterogeneity (\u03C4\u00B2, I\u00B2) and publication bias.\n  - **Sub", "Mistral": "Sure, let\u0027s break down each step to design a systematic review protocol on the effectiveness of telemedicine for diabetes management.\n\n### 1.
