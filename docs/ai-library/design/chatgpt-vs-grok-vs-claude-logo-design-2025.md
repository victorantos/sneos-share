Below is a comprehensive guide to launching and growing your logo design business:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Define Your Business Vision and Niche**\nBefore diving in, clarify your business goals and target market. Specializing in a niche can set you apart in a competitive market.\n\n- **Identify Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What makes your design approach unique?
