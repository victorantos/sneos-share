They are designed for beginners or those with limited funds who want to start building wealth. Below is a comparison of some popular micro-investing apps based on key features like fees, investment options, ease of use, and additional tools. The data is based on general information up to October 2023; always check the latest details on the app\u0027s website or terms before signing up.\n\n### Popular Micro-Investing Apps\n1. **Acorns**\n2. **Stash**\n3. **Robinhood**\n4. **Wealthfront** (more of a robo-advisor but offers low-entry investing)\n5. **Betterment** (similar to Wealthfront, with micro-investing potential)\n\n### Comparison Table\n\n| **App** | **Key Features** | **Fees** | **Investment Options** | **Minimum Investment** | **Best For** | **Pros** | **Cons** |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Acorns** | Round-up feature (invests spare change), automated investing, educational content | $1-$5/month (Lite: $1, Personal: $3, Family: $5) | ETFs (diversified portfolios) | $5 | Beginners, hands-off investors | Easy to use, automatic savings, educational tools | Limited investment choices, fees can add up for small balances |\n| **Stash** | Fractional shares, personalized advice, banking features in higher plans | $1-$9/month (Beginner: $1, Growth: $3, Stash\u002B: $9) | Stocks, ETFs, fractional shares | $0.01 (fractional shares) | Beginners wanting control over picks | Low entry cost, educational content, banking option | Monthly fees regardless of balance, limited advanced tools |\n| **Robinhood** | Commission-free trading, fractional shares, no account minimum | $0 (no commission on trades, optional Gold plan at $5/month for perks) | Stocks, ETFs, options, crypto | $1 (fractional shares) | Active investors, budget-conscious users | No fees for basic use, wide investment range | No automated investing, less guidance for newbies |\n| **Wealthfront** | Automated investing, tax-loss harvesting, goal-based planning | 0.25% annual advisory fee, no trading fees | ETFs (customized portfolios) | $500 | Hands-off investors with slightly more funds | Low fees, advanced features like tax optimization | Higher minimum, less control over investments |\n| **Betterment** | Goal-based investing, robo-advisor, tax-loss harvesting | 0.25% annual fee (Digital plan), 0.40% (Premium plan), no trading fees | ETFs (diversified portfolios) | $0 (Digital plan) | Beginners, long-term planners | No minimum for basic plan, solid planning tools | Annual fee can be pricey for small accounts, limited manual control |\n\n### Detailed Comparison Factors\n\n1. **Ease of Use**:\n - **Acorns** and **Stash** are highly user-friendly, with simple interfaces and automated features tailored for beginners.\n - **Robinhood** offers a clean design but requires more decision-making since it\u2019s not automated.\n - **Wealthfront** and **Betterment** are intuitive but cater slightly more to users comfortable with robo-advisors and long-term planning.\n\n2. **Fees**:\n - **Robinhood** stands out with no commissions or mandatory fees for basic use, ideal for cost-conscious users.\n - **Acorns** and **Stash** charge flat monthly fees, which can eat into returns if your balance is low (e.g., $3/month on a $50 balance is a high percentage).\n - **Wealthfront** and **Betterment** have percentage-based fees (0.25%-0.40%), which might be cheaper for smaller accounts compared to flat fees but scale with larger balances.\n\n3. **Investment Options**:\n - **Robinhood** and **Stash** offer the most flexibility, allowing investments in individual stocks and fractional shares.\n - **Acorns**, **Wealthfront**, and **Betterment** focus on diversified ETF portfolios, which are less risky but offer less control.\n\n4. **Minimum Investment**:\n - Most apps (except Wealthfront) have very low or no minimums, making them accessible for micro-investors.\n - **Wealthfront**\u2019s $500 minimum might be a barrier for true micro-investing.\n\n5. **Additional Features**:\n - **Acorns**: Round-up feature and \u201CFound Money\u201D (cashback from partnered brands).\n - **Stash**: Educational resources and a banking account in higher tiers.\n - **Robinhood**: Crypto trading and margin trading (for advanced users via Gold plan).\n - **Wealthfront/Betterment**: Advanced financial planning tools, tax-loss harvesting, and goal tracking.\n\n### Which App Should You Choose?\n- **If you\u2019re a total beginner and want automation**: Go with **Acorns** for its round-up feature and simplicity, but watch the fees.\n- **If you want to pick your own stocks with low costs**: Choose **Robinhood** for commission-free trading and flexibility.\n- **If you want a mix of guidance and control**: **Stash** is a good middle ground with fractional shares and advice.\n- **If you have a slightly larger starting amount and prefer a hands-off approach**: **Wealthfront** or **Betterment** offers robust robo-advising with low annual fees.\n\n### Things to Consider\n- **Fees vs. Balance**: If your investment is small (under $500), flat monthly fees (like Acorns or Stash) can be costlier than percentage-based fees (like Betterment).\n- **Investment Goals**: Are you saving for a specific goal (Betterment/Wealthfront) or experimenting with stocks (Robinhood/Stash)?\n- **Risk Tolerance**: Automated ETF portfolios (Acorns, Wealthfront) are generally safer than individual stocks (Robinhood, Stash).\n\n### Conclusion\nEach micro-investing app caters to slightly different needs. For absolute beginners with little money to invest, **Acorns** or **Stash** might feel most approachable. For those wanting no fees and more control, **Robinhood** is a strong choice. For slightly larger investments with a long-term focus, **Wealthfront** or **Betterment** could be more suitable. Assess your budget, goals, and how much effort you want to put into investing before deciding.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a deeper dive into a specific app or feature (like round-ups or tax-loss harvesting), let me know!
