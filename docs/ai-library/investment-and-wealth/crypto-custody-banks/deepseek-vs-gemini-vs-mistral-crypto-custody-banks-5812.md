  :responses='{"DeepSeek": "Of course. This is a very common point of confusion for people new to crypto taxes.\n\nLet\u0027s clarify the roles:\n\n**Banks** and **Crypto Exchanges** are two different types of financial institutions. Your bank does **not** automatically receive your crypto transaction details for tax reporting.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how it works, what is reported, and what your responsibilities are.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Key Difference: Banks vs. Crypto Exchanges\n\n* **Banks (e.g., Chase, Bank of America):**\n * **Role:** They deal with traditional fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.).\n * **Tax Reporting:** They report certain activities to the IRS and to you on forms like:\n * **Form 1099-INT:** For interest earned on savings accounts.\n * **Form 1099-DIV:** For dividends from investments.\n * **Form 1099-B:** For stock sales (provided by your broker, not the bank itself).\n * **They do NOT** report your crypto purchases, sales, or trades.\n\n* **Crypto Exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Kraken, Binance.US):**\n * **Role:** They facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies.\n * **Tax Reporting:** The IRS now requires major exchanges to report certain activities, similar to how stock brokers do.\n * **Form 1099-MISC:** Was used in the past for certain earnings, but this is now rare for crypto.\n * **Form 1099-K:** Reports total payment volume from goods/services or certain types of transactions. The reporting threshold has been changing, causing confusion.\n * **The New Standard: Form 1099-B (Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions) and a new **Form 1099-DA** (Digital Asset)**. Starting with the 2025 tax year (filed in 2026), exchanges will be required to use this new form to report gross proceeds from digital asset sales and dispositions.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the IRS Knows About Your Crypto Activity\n\nThe IRS finds out about your crypto in several ways:\n\n1. **Direct Reporting from Exchanges:** As mentioned above, regulated US exchanges (like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken) are legally required to report your transaction history to the IRS if you meet certain thresholds, especially for sales. They also send you a copy of the form (e.g., 1099-B).\n2. **IRS John Doe Summonses:** The IRS has a history of issuing summonses to major exchanges to obtain user records for accounts with significant trading volume. They did this to Coinbase in 2016 and more recently to Kraken and Circle.\n3. **The Question on Form 1040:** Since 2020, the front page of the U.S. individual tax return (Form 1040) has included the following question: *\u0022At any time during 2023, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?\u0022*\n * You are legally required to answer this question **Yes** or **No**. Lying on this form is perjury.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Your Tax Reporting Responsibility (This is the Critical Part)\n\n**Even if you don\u0027t receive a tax form from an exchange, you are still legally responsible for reporting all taxable crypto events.**\n\nThe form you receive (like a 1099-B from an exchange) only tells the IRS about the *proceeds* from your sales. It does **not** calculate your gain or loss.\n\n* **You** are responsible for calculating your **cost basis** (what you originally paid for the crypto) and your **capital gain or loss**.\n* This calculation must be reported on two forms:\n 1. **Form 8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets):** This is where you list every single taxable transaction (sale, trade, spend) with its date acquired, date sold, proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss.\n 2. **Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses):** This is the summary form that totals the numbers from your Form 8949.\n\n**Example:** You buy 1 ETH for $2,000 and later sell it for $3,000 on an exchange. The exchange will report the $3,000 *proceeds* to the IRS on a 1099-B. You must report the *sale* and calculate the $1,000 *capital gain* on your Form 8949 and Schedule D.\n\n---\n\n### 4. The Bank\u0027s Role in Your Crypto Transactions\n\nYour bank\u0027s only involvement is as the on/off ramp for fiat currency. They will see:\n\n* **Outgoing Wire/ACH Transfers:** When you send money *to* an exchange like Coinbase.\n* **Incoming Deposits:** When you withdraw money *from* an exchange to your bank account.\n\nThe bank will report large cash deposits (over $10,000) on a **Currency Transaction Report (CTR)** to combat money laundering, but they have no way of knowing if that money came from crypto profits, a car sale, or a personal loan. They do not report it as \u0022crypto income.\u0022\n\n### Summary and Action Plan\n\n1. **Your Bank is Not Your Crypto Tax Reporter.** They don\u0027t see your trades and don\u0027t report them to the IRS.\n2. **Your Crypto Exchange is Your Starting Point.** Download a complete transaction history (CSV file) from every exchange and wallet you use.\n3. **Use Crypto Tax Software.** Manually calculating gains/losses is nearly impossible. Use services like:\n * **Koinly**\n * **CoinTracker**\n * **TokenTax**\n * **CryptoTrader.Tax**\n These platforms import your transaction history and automatically calculate your gains, losses, and income, then generate the necessary IRS forms (8949, etc.).\n4. **Report Accurately on Your Tax Return.** Use the reports from the tax software to fill out your Form 8949 and Schedule D, and remember to answer \u0022Yes\u0022 to the digital asset question on Form 1040.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI assistant and not a tax professional. This information is for educational purposes only. You should consult with a qualified tax advisor or CPA experienced in cryptocurrency for advice tailored to your specific situation.", "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down how banks are involved in crypto tax reporting and what you need to know.\n\n**The Role of Banks in Crypto Tax Reporting**\n\nBanks don\u0027t directly report your crypto transactions to the IRS (in most cases, *yet*). However, they play a crucial role because they are the primary on-ramp and off-ramp between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Here\u0027s how:\n\n* **Transaction Data:** Banks track your deposits and withdrawals. If you\u0027re buying crypto with funds from your bank account or selling crypto and depositing the proceeds into your bank account, the bank has a record of those transactions. While they don\u0027t know *what* you did with the money afterward (e.g., bought Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), they know the money moved.\n\n* **Potential Scrutiny:** Large or unusual transfers to or from crypto exchanges can trigger scrutiny from the bank. Banks are required to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Suspicious activity reports (SARs) might be filed if a bank suspects illegal activity. A large, sudden influx of cash from a crypto exchange might raise a flag.\n\n* **Information Requests:** The IRS can (and does) request information from banks about their customers\u0027 accounts. If the IRS is investigating your crypto activity, they can subpoena your bank records to see the flow of funds.\n\n* **Form 1099-MISC/1099-NEC (Potentially):** While not yet widely implemented, there\u0027s a potential future where banks could be required to report crypto transactions on Form 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC if they are deemed to be acting as payment processors. This is more likely to apply to banks that directly facilitate crypto transactions (e.g., offering crypto services within their banking app).\n\n**Why This Matters for You**\n\n* **Accurate Record Keeping is Essential:** You are responsible for accurately reporting your crypto gains and losses on your tax return. The bank records can help you reconstruct your transaction history, especially if you\u0027ve lost or misplaced records from crypto exchanges.\n\n* **Reconciling Bank Statements:** Compare your bank statements with your crypto exchange records. Make sure you can account for all transfers to and from your crypto accounts. Discrepancies can raise red flags with the IRS if they investigate.\n\n* **Tax Compliance is Your Responsibility:** Don\u0027t assume your bank is handling your crypto taxes for you. They are not. You need to track your cost basis, sales proceeds, and calculate your gains or losses. Use crypto tax software or consult with a tax professional to ensure compliance.\n\n**What Banks *Don\u0027t* Do (Typically)**\n\n* **Calculate Your Crypto Gains/Losses:** Banks don\u0027t know how much you bought your crypto for, what you traded it for, or what your cost basis is. They only see the dollar amounts moving in and out of your account.\n* **Report Directly to the IRS (Currently, in most cases):** Banks are generally *not* directly reporting your crypto transactions to the IRS in the same way that brokers report stock sales on Form 1099-B. The reporting landscape is evolving, so this could change in the future.\n* **Provide Tax Advice:** Banks are not tax advisors. Don\u0027t rely on them for guidance on how to handle your crypto taxes.\n\n**Future Developments**\n\n* **Increased Scrutiny and Regulation:** Expect increased scrutiny of crypto transactions by banks and regulators. The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving.\n* **Potential for Standardized Reporting:** There\u0027s a push for standardized reporting of crypto transactions, similar to how stock transactions are reported. This could eventually involve banks playing a more direct role in reporting.\n* **CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies):** If central banks issue digital currencies, it could significantly change the way crypto transactions are tracked and reported.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* **Use Crypto Tax Software:** Software like CoinTracker, ZenLedger, TaxBit, or others can help you track your transactions, calculate your gains/losses, and generate the necessary tax forms.\n* **Keep Detailed Records:** Maintain a meticulous record of all your crypto transactions, including dates, amounts, cost basis, and sales proceeds.\n* **Consult a Tax Professional:** If you have complex crypto transactions or are unsure about your tax obligations, consult with a tax professional who specializes in crypto.\n* **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date on the latest crypto tax regulations and guidance from the IRS.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nBanks are a key piece of the puzzle when it comes to crypto tax reporting, even though they don\u0027t directly report your crypto gains and losses (yet). They track the flow of funds, and the IRS can access this information. You are responsible for accurately reporting your crypto taxes, and bank records can help you with that. Stay organized, use appropriate tools, and seek professional advice when needed.\n", "Mistral": "Crypto tax reporting involves accurately documenting and reporting your cryptocurrency transactions to tax authorities. Banks play a crucial role in this process, especially as regulatory frameworks around the world become more stringent. Here are some key points to consider regarding crypto tax reporting and banks:\n\n### 1. **Bank Statements and Transaction Records**\n - **Bank Statements**: Banks provide statements that can be used to verify transactions, including those involving cryptocurrencies. These statements are essential for accurate tax reporting.\n - **Transaction Records**: Detailed records of transactions, including dates, amounts, and types of cryptocurrencies, are necessary for tax reporting. Banks can provide these records for fiat-to-crypto transactions.\n\n### 2. **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance**\n - **KYC/AML**: Banks are required to comply with KYC and AML regulations, which often involve reporting suspicious activities. This can include large or unusual cryptocurrency transactions.\n - **Reporting Requirements**: Banks may be obligated to report certain transactions to regulatory authorities, which can impact your tax reporting obligations.\n\n### 3. **Tax Forms and Reporting**\n - **Form 1099-B**: In the United States, banks and financial institutions may issue Form 1099-B to report proceeds from broker and barter exchange transactions, including cryptocurrency sales.\n - **Form 8949**: This form is used to report capital gains and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n - **Form 1040**: The standard U.S. individual income tax return, where you report your total income, including gains from cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n### 4. **International Considerations**\n - **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)**: U.S. citizens and residents must report foreign financial accounts, including those holding cryptocurrencies, if the total value exceeds certain thresholds.\n - **Common Reporting Standard (CRS)**: An international standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information between governments. Banks in participating countries must report account information, including cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n### 5. **Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Banks**\n - **Exchange Reporting**: Cryptocurrency exchanges often work with banks to facilitate fiat-to-crypto transactions. These exchanges may also provide tax reporting tools and forms.\n - **Bank Integration**: Some banks offer integrated services with cryptocurrency exchanges, making it easier to track and report transactions.\n\n### 6. **Tax Software and Tools**\n - **Tax Software**: Many tax preparation software programs now include features for reporting cryptocurrency transactions. These tools can integrate with bank statements and transaction records.\n - **Crypto Tax Tools**: Specialized tools like CoinTracker, Koinly, and TaxBit can help you track and report your cryptocurrency transactions accurately.\n\n### 7. **Professional Advice**\n - **Tax Advisors**: Consulting with a tax advisor or accountant who specializes in cryptocurrency can help ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.\n - **Legal Advice**: In complex cases, seeking legal advice may be necessary to navigate the regulatory landscape.\n\n### 8. **Regulatory Changes**\n - **Stay Informed**: Cryptocurrency tax regulations are evolving rapidly. Stay informed about changes in tax laws and reporting requirements in your jurisdiction.\n - **Compliance**: Ensure that you comply with all relevant tax laws to avoid penalties and legal issues.\n\n### Conclusion\nCrypto tax reporting involves a complex interplay between banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and regulatory authorities. Accurate record-keeping, compliance with KYC/AML regulations, and the use of specialized tools and professional advice are essential for navigating this landscape effectively."}'
