  :responses='{"DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a guide to plain language legal writing, broken down into its core principles, techniques, and examples.\n\n### What is Plain Language Legal Writing?\n\nPlain language legal writing is a method of communicating legal information that is clear, concise, and easily understood by the intended audience on the first read. It\u0027s not about \u0022dumbing down\u0022 the law; it\u0027s about removing unnecessary complexity to enhance precision, reduce ambiguity, and save everyone time and money.\n\nThe goal is for the reader to **understand their rights, duties, and the legal consequences** without needing a law degree to decipher the text.\n\n---\n\n### Core Principles\n\n1. **Know Your Audience:** Are you writing for a client, a judge, a jury, or a opposing counsel? Adjust your language and level of detail accordingly. A letter to a client should be simpler than a brief for a Supreme Court justice.\n2. **Clarity Over Tradition:** Prioritize being understood over using traditional \u0022legalese.\u0022 Just because a phrase is old doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s the best way to communicate today.\n3. **Conciseness is Key:** Eliminate every unnecessary word. Long, convoluted sentences are the enemy of understanding.\n4. **Structure for Understanding:** Use headings, lists, and a logical flow to guide the reader through the document.\n\n---\n\n### How to Do It: A Practical Guide\n\n#### 1. Replace Legalese with Plain English\n\n| Instead Of (Legalese) | Use This (Plain English) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| herein, hereinabove, hereinafter | in this document, above, below |\n| forthwith | immediately, now |\n| said (as in \u0022the said property\u0022) | the, this, that |\n| pursuant to | under, according to, following |\n| prior to | before |\n| subsequent to | after |\n| in the event that | if |\n| for the purpose of | to, for |\n| null and void | void, invalid |\n\n#### 2. Prefer Strong, Simple Verbs\n\nWeak, noun-heavy phrasing (called \u0022nominalizations\u0022) makes writing clunky.\n\n* **Weak:** \u0022The parties shall engage in a discussion regarding the terms.\u0022\n* **Strong:** \u0022The parties **will discuss** the terms.\u0022\n* **Weak:** \u0022We will conduct an investigation of the matter.\u0022\n* **Strong:** \u0022We will **investigate** the matter.\u0022\n* **Weak:** \u0022The court made a determination that...\u0022\n* **Strong:** \u0022The court **determined** that...\u0022\n\n#### 3. Use the Active Voice\n\nThe active voice is direct and makes it clear who is responsible for an action.\n\n* **Passive:** \u0022The motion was filed by the plaintiff.\u0022 (Who filed it? Oh, the plaintiff.)\n* **Active:** \u0022The plaintiff filed the motion.\u0022\n* **Passive:** \u0022The contract shall be signed by all parties.\u0022 (It\u0027s a bit abstract.)\n* **Active:** \u0022All parties must sign the contract.\u0022\n\n**Exception:** Use the passive voice intentionally when the actor is unknown or unimportant (e.g., \u0022The store was robbed.\u0022).\n\n#### 4. Keep Sentences Short and Manageable\n\nAim for an average of 15-20 words per sentence. Break up long, multi-clause sentences.\n\n* **Complex:** \u0022Provider, at its sole discretion, may terminate this Agreement for cause upon written notice to Client in the event of Client\u2019s material breach of any term herein, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following Client\u2019s receipt of such notice.\u0022\n* **Plain Language:** \u0022We may terminate this agreement if you materially breach any of its terms. To do so, we will send you a written notice. You will then have 30 days to fix the problem. If you do not fix it within that time, we may end the agreement.\u0022\n\n#### 5. Use \u0022You,\u0022 \u0022We,\u0022 and Names\n\nAddress the reader directly. It\u2019s clearer and more engaging.\n\n* **Impersonal:** \u0022The Tenant is obligated to pay the rent on the first day of the month.\u0022\n* **Direct:** \u0022You must pay your rent on the first day of each month.\u0022\n* **Impersonal:** \u0022It is the policy of the Company that employees shall not...\u0022\n* **Direct:** \u0022We require that our employees do not...\u0022\n\n#### 6. Organize with Clear Structure\n\n* **Headings and Subheadings:** Use descriptive headings to signal the content of each section.\n* **Lists:** Use bullet points for non-sequential items and numbered lists for steps or priorities.\n* **White Space:** Don\u0027t fear empty space. Ample margins and paragraph breaks make a document less intimidating and easier to read.\n\n#### 7. Define Terms Carefully\n\nIf you must use a technical term, define it clearly when it first appears.\n\n* **Example:** \u0022The \u0027Effective Date\u0027 means the date this agreement is signed by the last party to sign it.\u0022\n\n---\n\n### Before-and-After Examples\n\n**Example 1: A Contract Clause**\n\n* **Traditional:**\n \u003E \u0022Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of a default by the Tenant under any of the covenants or terms of this Lease, the Landlord shall be entitled to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity.\u0022\n\n* **Plain Language:**\n \u003E \u0022If you break any part of this lease, we can use any legal right available to us under the law.\u0022\n\n**Example 2: A Client Letter**\n\n* **Traditional:**\n \u003E \u0022Pursuant to our recent conversation, enclosed herewith please find the requisite documentation necessitating your signature prior to the commencement of the probate process.\u0022\n\n* **Plain Language:**\n \u003E \u0022As we discussed, I have enclosed the documents you need to sign before we can start the probate process.\u0022\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of Plain Language\n\n* **Fewer Disputes:** Clear language reduces ambiguity, which is a primary source of litigation.\n* **Increased Efficiency:** Clients understand what to do, and courts understand your arguments faster.\n* **Better Client Relationships:** Clients feel more empowered and less in the dark.\n* **Enhanced Professionalism:** It demonstrates confidence and a focus on the client\u0027s needs, not just on legal ritual.\n\nIn short, plain language is **better lawyering**. It ensures your brilliant legal analysis is not lost in a fog of archaic and convoluted prose.", "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down plain language legal writing.
