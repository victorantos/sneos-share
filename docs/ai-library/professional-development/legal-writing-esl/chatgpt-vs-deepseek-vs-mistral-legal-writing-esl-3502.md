    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a brief guide to better writing, specifically designed for non-native speakers. It focuses on clarity, simplicity, and avoiding common mistakes.\n\n### The Golden Rule: Keep It Simple\n\nYour goal is to be understood, not to sound like a Shakespeare. Using simple, clear language is a sign of strong communication skills.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Sentence Structure: Short \u0026 Clear\n\n*   **Problem:** Long, complicated sentences with many clauses.\n*   **Solution:** Use short sentences. One main idea per sentence.\n\n*   **Instead of:** \u0022The meeting, which was scheduled for 3 PM and was supposed to cover the quarterly budget, has been postponed until next week because the manager is ill.\u0022\n*   **Write:** \u0022The 3 PM meeting about the quarterly budget is postponed. The manager is ill. It will be held next week.\u0022\n\n### 2. Vocabulary: Choose Simple Words\n\nDon\u0027t try to impress with complex words. Use the most common and direct word you know.\n\n*   **Instead of:** **Utilize**, **commence**, **approximately**, **assist**\n*   **Write:** **Use**, **start/begin**, **about**, **help**\n\n### 3. Grammar: Focus on the Big Issues\n\nYou don\u0027t need perfect grammar, but fixing these common errors will make your writing much clearer.\n\n**A. Verb Tenses: Keep it Consistent**\n*   Stick to the past, present, or future. Don\u0027t switch back and forth unnecessarily.\n*   **Instead of:** \u0022I **write** the report yesterday.\u0022 (Wrong tense)\n*   **Write:** \u0022I **wrote** the report yesterday.\u0022\n\n**B. Articles (a, an, the)**\nThis is very difficult, but here\u0027s a simple trick:\n*   Use **\u0022a\u0022** (or **\u0022an\u0022** before a vowel sound) for something general or mentioned for the first time.\n    *   \u0022We need **a** new computer.\u0022\n*   Use **\u0022the\u0022** for something specific or already mentioned.\n    *   \u0022**The** computer we bought is fast.\u0022 (We know which computer.)\n*   Use **no article** for general concepts, countries, or cities.\n    *   \u0022I need **information**. She lives in **Japan**.\u0022\n\n**C. Prepositions (in, on, at, for, etc.)**\nPrepositions are tricky because the rules aren\u0027t always logical. The best way is to learn them in common phrases.\n*   **IN** a document, **IN** July, **IN** a city/country\n*   **ON** a page, **ON** Monday, **ON** the internet\n*   **AT** 9:00 AM, **AT** the office\n*   If you are unsure, check a dictionary or use Google to see common examples.\n\n**D. Subject-Verb Agreement**\nThe verb must match the subject (the person or thing doing the action).\n*   **He/She/It** \u2192 verb \u002B **s** (in the present tense)\n    *   \u0022He **manages** the team.\u0022 (Not \u0022He manage...\u0022)\n*   **I/You/We/They** \u2192 verb without **s**\n    *   \u0022They **manage** the team.\u0022\n\n### 4. Be Direct and Professional\n\n**A. Avoid Idioms and Slang**\nPhrases like \u0022piece of cake\u0022 (easy) or \u0022hit the ground running\u0022 (start quickly) can be confusing. Say what you mean directly.\n\n**B. Use Active Voice (When Possible)**\nActive voice is clearer and stronger than passive voice.\n*   **Passive (weak):** \u0022The report was written by me.\u0022 (The subject is acted upon)\n*   **Active (strong):** \u0022I wrote the report.\u0022 (The subject does the action)\n\n### 5. Practical Tips for Better Writing\n\n1.  **Read Your Writing Aloud:** This is the best way to catch mistakes. If a sentence is difficult to say, it is probably difficult to read. Rewrite it.\n2.  **Use Tools (But Be Careful):**\n    *   **Grammar Checkers:** Use Grammarly or the spell-check in your word processor. They are good for catching basic errors, but don\u0027t rely on them completely.\n    *   **Google Translate/Deepl:** Good for translating *individual words* or *short phrases*. Do **not** use them for entire sentences or paragraphs, as the grammar is often wrong.\n3.  **Have a \u0022Model File\u0022:** Save emails or texts from native speakers that you think are well-written. Use them as a model for your own writing.\n4.  **Plan Before You Write:**\n    *   **Why** are you writing? (To inform, to request, to apologize?)\n    *   **What** are your main points? (List 1-3 key points.)\n    *   **Who** is your reader? (A boss, a colleague, a friend?)\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist Before You Send\n\n*   [ ] Are my sentences short?\n*   [ ] Did I use simple, clear words?\n*   [ ] Do my verbs match my subjects? (He **has**, They **have**)\n*   [ ] Did I check the tenses?\n*   [ ] Did I read it aloud to myself?\n\nRemember, practice is the most important thing. The more you write, the more confident you will become. Good luck",
