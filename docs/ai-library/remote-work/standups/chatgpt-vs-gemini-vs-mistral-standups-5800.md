  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a simple and effective format for an **async standup meeting** \u2014 a daily status update done asynchronously, often via chat or collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or project management software.\n\n---\n\n### Async Standup Meeting Format\n\n**Purpose:** \nTo keep the team aligned on progress, blockers, and plans without needing to gather everyone at the same time.\n\n---\n\n#### Suggested Template (to be filled out by each team member)\n\n1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?** \n *(Brief summary of completed tasks or progress)*\n\n2. **What am I working on today?** \n *(Priorities or goals for the current day)*\n\n3. **Are there any blockers or issues?** \n *(Anything preventing progress or needing help)*\n\n4. *(Optional)* **Additional notes or announcements** \n *(Relevant info for the team, resources needed, etc.)*\n\n---\n\n### Example Message\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n**Name:** Alice\n\n1. What did I accomplish yesterday? \n- Completed the user authentication module. \n- Reviewed PRs for the frontend team.\n\n2. What am I working on today? \n- Start integrating the payment API. \n- Write unit tests for the auth module.\n\n3. Are there any blockers or issues? \n- Waiting for API credentials from the vendor.\n\n4. Additional notes: \n- Reminder: sprint planning meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n---\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Set a deadline:** Ensure updates are posted by a certain time each day (e.g., before 10 AM).\n- **Use a dedicated channel or thread:** Keep all async standup updates organized.\n- **Prompt collaboration:** Team members can comment or follow up on blockers directly in the thread.\n- **Keep it concise:** Focus on key updates to respect everyone\u2019s time.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a sample template for a specific tool or platform?", "Gemini": "An async standup meeting format allows teams to stay updated and connected without the constraints of a real-time meeting. Here\u0027s a comprehensive format, incorporating best practices:\n\n**1. Platform Choice:**\n\n* **Dedicated Standup Tool (Highly Recommended):** Tools like Geekbot, Standuply, Range, DailyBot, or JIRA Stand-up apps automate the process, offer reporting features, and integrate with other workflow tools (Slack, MS Teams, etc.). These are designed specifically for asynchronous standups.\n* **Project Management Software (e.g., Asana, Jira, Trello):** Use comment sections, tasks with progress updates, or dedicated fields to share standup information. Requires more manual effort.\n* **Communication Platform (Slack, MS Teams, Email):** Less ideal, but can work if you create a consistent and organized channel/thread. Can become disorganized quickly.\n* **Document/Spreadsheet:** Can work for very small teams, but difficult to scale and lacks automation.\n\n**2. Core Questions (The Standard):**\n\nThese are the three fundamental questions every team member should answer:\n\n* **What did you work on yesterday (or since the last standup)?** Focus on accomplishments, completed tasks, and progress made. Be specific! \u0022Worked on the website\u0022 is vague. \u0022Implemented the user authentication feature on the website\u0022 is much better.\n* **What are you working on today (or until the next standup)?** Plan for the day, outlining key tasks and priorities. Provides visibility into the team\u0027s workload.\n* **Are there any roadblocks or impediments preventing you from doing your work?** This is crucial for identifying and addressing potential issues early. Be specific about the problem and what support you might need.\n\n**3. Enhanced Questions/Additions (Optional, Tailor to Your Team):**\n\nConsider adding these questions to provide more context or focus on specific areas:\n\n* **What are your priorities today?** (If not covered in the \u0022working on today\u0022 question)\n* **What are your goals for the week?** (Good for longer-term alignment)\n* **What help do you need?** (More direct than just listing roadblocks)\n* **What did you learn yesterday?** (Promotes continuous learning)\n* **Whom did you collaborate with yesterday?** (Highlights team interaction)\n* **What are you grateful for?** (For building a positive team culture \u2013 use sparingly!)\n* **What are you excited about?** (Also for positive culture, can be related to work or not)\n* **Anything blocking anyone else?** (Encourages team to help each other)\n* **What\u0027s your mood like today?** (Allows for awareness of team well-being - optional and requires trust)\n\n**4. Process \u0026 Cadence:**\n\n* **Frequency:** Typically daily, but can be adjusted based on team needs (e.g., every other day). Consistency is key.\n* **Timing/Deadline:** Set a clear deadline for submissions (e.g., 10:00 AM local time). This ensures everyone reads the updates before starting their day. Staggering deadlines based on time zones can be helpful for distributed teams.\n* **Format Consistency:** Ensure everyone uses the same format and answers all questions. This makes updates easier to read and compare.\n* **Reading \u0026 Engagement:** Emphasize the importance of *reading* everyone else\u0027s updates. Encourage brief acknowledgements (\u0022Thanks!\u0022, \u0022\u002B1 on that\u0022, \u0022Good luck!\u0022) to show you\u0027ve read the update and to foster a sense of connection. *Don\u0027t overdo it with unnecessary replies.*\n* **Roadblock Resolution:** Address roadblocks outside the standup thread. Encourage team members to schedule separate calls or use direct messages to discuss solutions. The standup is for identifying problems, not solving them.\n* **Regular Review:** Periodically review the standup process with the team. Are the questions still relevant? Is the process efficient? Make adjustments as needed.\n\n**5. Example Using a Standup Tool (Geekbot/Standuply/Similar):**\n\n1. **Tool Setup:** Configure the tool to ask the agreed-upon questions (e.g., the core three).\n2. **Schedule:** Set the schedule for when the tool will send out the questions to each team member (considering their time zones).\n3. **Team Members Respond:** Each team member receives the questions via Slack/MS Teams and submits their answers.\n4. **Summary:** The tool compiles all the answers into a summary and posts it to a designated channel.\n5. **Follow-up:** Team members read the summary and follow up on any roadblocks or issues offline.\n\n**6. Example using Slack/Teams:**\n\n1. **Channel:** Create a dedicated channel called \u0060#standup\u0060 or similar.\n2. **Bot (Optional but Recommended):** Use a bot (if possible) to post the standup questions at a set time each day. This helps maintain consistency.\n3. **Template:** Provide a template for team members to copy and paste into the channel each day:\n\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n **Name:** [Your Name]\n **Yesterday:** [What you worked on]\n **Today:** [What you\u0027re working on]\n **Roadblocks:** [Any issues you\u0027re facing]\n \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n4. **Replies:** Encourage short, relevant replies to acknowledge updates or offer help (e.g., \u0022Great work!\u0022, \u0022I can help with that roadblock\u0022).\n5. **Thread Discipline:** Ensure all standup responses are posted as *replies* to the initial bot message (or the first message of the day). This keeps the channel clean and organized.\n\n**7. Best Practices \u0026 Tips:**\n\n* **Be Concise:** Keep answers brief and to the point. Standups are not for lengthy discussions. Aim for a few sentences per answer.\n* **Be Specific:** Avoid vague statements. Provide concrete details about your progress and plans.\n* **Be Honest:** Be upfront about roadblocks and challenges. This allows the team to provide support and find solutions.\n* **Focus on Progress:** Highlight accomplishments and progress made, even if it\u0027s incremental.\n* **Avoid Problem Solving in the Standup:** Identify problems, but discuss solutions offline.\n* **Encourage Team Engagement:** Promote a culture of reading and acknowledging each other\u0027s updates.\n* **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the standup process and make adjustments as needed. Ask the team for feedback.\n* **Lead by Example:** Managers and team leads should actively participate in the standup and demonstrate the desired behavior.\n* **Time Zone Considerations:** For distributed teams, be mindful of time zones when setting deadlines and schedules. Consider using tools that adjust to each team member\u0027s local time.\n* **Respect Time:** Async standups are meant to save time. Avoid unnecessary chatter or lengthy responses.\n* **Visuals:** Use screenshots, GIFs, or short videos (where appropriate) to illustrate your updates.\n\n**Why Async Standups Work:**\n\n* **Flexibility:** Team members can contribute updates at their convenience, fitting it into their workflow.\n* **Improved Focus:** No interruptions for a scheduled meeting.\n* **Reduced Meeting Fatigue:** Eliminates unnecessary meetings.\n* **Better Documentation:** Creates a written record of progress and roadblocks.\n* **Inclusivity:** Gives all team members an equal opportunity to contribute, regardless of their location or communication style.\n* **Accommodates Different Work Styles:** Introverts and those who prefer written communication may find it easier to participate in async standups.\n\nBy implementing these guidelines, you can create an effective and efficient asynchronous standup process that keeps your team informed, aligned, and productive. Remember to tailor the format to your team\u0027s specific needs and culture.\n", "Mistral": "An effective async (asynchronous) standup meeting format allows team members to share updates and collaborate without needing to be present at the same time. This is particularly useful for remote teams or teams spread across different time zones. Here\u0027s a structured format for an async standup meeting:\n\n### 1. **Introduction**\n - **Purpose**: Clearly state the purpose of the standup meeting.\n - **Guidelines**: Provide guidelines on how to participate, such as the format for updates and any deadlines.\n\n### 2. **Updates**\n Each team member provides updates in a structured format. This can be done via a shared document, a project management tool, or a dedicated communication channel. The updates typically include:\n\n - **What I did yesterday**: A brief summary of tasks completed the previous day.\n - **What I plan to do today**: A list of tasks planned for the current day.\n - **Blockers**: Any obstacles or issues that are preventing progress.\n\n### 3. **Discussion**\n - **Comments and Questions**: Team members can comment on each other\u0027s updates, ask questions, or provide feedback.\n - **Collaboration**: Encourage team members to collaborate on solving blockers or addressing issues.\n\n### 4. **Action Items**\n - **Follow-ups**: Identify any follow-up actions or tasks that need to be addressed.\n - **Assignments**: Assign responsibilities for follow-up actions.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n - **Summary**: Summarize the key points discussed and any action items.\n - **Next Steps**: Outline the next steps and any upcoming deadlines.\n\n### Example Format in a Shared Document\n\n#### **Team Member: [Name]**\n\n**What I did yesterday:**\n- Completed the design for the new feature.\n- Reviewed the code for the login module.\n\n**What I plan to do today:**\n- Start implementing the new feature.\n- Attend the design review meeting.\n\n**Blockers:**\n- Need clarification on the API requirements for the new feature.\n\n#### **Team Member: [Name]**\n\n**What I did yesterday:**\n- Fixed bugs in the payment processing module.\n- Updated the documentation for the API.\n\n**What I plan to do today:**\n- Continue working on the payment processing module.\n- Participate in the code review session.\n\n**Blockers:**\n- None.\n\n### Tools for Async Standup Meetings\n\n- **Project Management Tools**: Jira, Trello, Asana\n- **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace\n- **Shared Documents**: Google Docs, Microsoft OneNote\n\n### Tips for Success\n\n- **Consistency**: Ensure that updates are provided consistently, ideally at the same time each day.\n- **Clarity**: Be clear and concise in your updates.\n- **Engagement**: Encourage active participation and engagement from all team members.\n- **Follow-up**: Make sure to follow up on any blockers or issues raised during the standup.\n\nBy following this structured format, you can ensure that your async standup meetings are productive and effective, even when team members are working at different times."}'
