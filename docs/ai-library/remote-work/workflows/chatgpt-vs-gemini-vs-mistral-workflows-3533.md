  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Asynchronous workflows are processes where tasks run independently of the main program flow, allowing other tasks to continue without waiting for the asynchronous task to complete. This is common in programming, workflow automation, and distributed systems. Below are some examples of asynchronous workflows in different contexts:\n\n### 1. **Web Development (JavaScript Promises / Async-Await)**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\nasync function fetchUserData() {\n try {\n let response = await fetch(\u0027https://api.example.com/user\u0027);\n let data = await response.json();\n console.log(data);\n } catch (error) {\n console.error(\u0027Error fetching data\u0027, error);\n }\n}\n\nfetchUserData();\nconsole.log(\u0027This log happens before data fetching finishes\u0027);\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n**Explanation:** The function \u0060fetchUserData\u0060 fetches data asynchronously. The rest of the code continues while the network request is pending.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Message Queue Based Workflow**\n- **Producer** submits a task to a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS).\n- **Consumer** asynchronously picks up tasks from the queue and processes them.\n- Producer does not wait for the consumer to finish.\n\n**Example Scenario:** Video processing pipeline \n- Upload video \u2192 Producer places job in queue \u2192 Consumer processes video (transcoding, thumbnails) \u2192 Updates status asynchronously.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Asynchronous Email Sending (Backend)**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\nfrom celery import Celery\n\napp = Celery(\u0027tasks\u0027, broker=\u0027pyamqp://guest@localhost//\u0027)\n\n@app.task\ndef send_email_async(email_data):\n # logic to send email\n print(f\u0022Sending email to {email_data[\u0027to\u0027]}\u0022)\n\n# Trigger email sending in an async way\nsend_email_async.delay({\u0027to\u0027: \u0027user@example.com\u0027, \u0027subject\u0027: \u0027Welcome\u0027})\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n**Explanation:** Sending emails can be time-consuming, so it\u2019s handled asynchronously using a task queue like Celery.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Long-Running ETL Jobs**\n- Extract data from source asynchronously.\n- Transform data while extracting.\n- Load data into database after transform completes.\n- Each step triggers the next asynchronously, allowing pipeline stages to run in parallel.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Asynchronous Microservices Communication**\n- Microservice A sends an event/message to a Kafka topic.\n- Microservice B consumes the event and processes it.\n- Neither service waits synchronously for the other.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Mobile App Network Calls**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060swift\nURLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in\n // handle response asynchronously\n}.resume()\n\nprint(\u0022Network call initiated, UI remains responsive\u0022)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nThe network request runs asynchronously, preventing UI blocking.\n\n---\n\nIf you want examples in a specific programming language, framework, or domain, please let me know!", "Gemini": "## Asynchronous Workflow Examples\n\nAsynchronous workflows are workflows where tasks don\u0027t have to be executed sequentially, one after the other. Instead, tasks can be initiated and then the system can move on to other tasks without waiting for the first one to complete. This improves responsiveness and scalability. Here are some examples across different domains:\n\n**1. E-commerce Order Processing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A customer places an order on an e-commerce website.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Payment Processing:** Initiate the payment process with a payment gateway. The system doesn\u0027t wait for confirmation before proceeding to other tasks. A callback or message queue is used to handle success/failure notifications.\n * **Order Confirmation Email:** Queue a task to send the order confirmation email.\n * **Inventory Update:** Queue a task to update the inventory system to reflect the purchased items.\n * **Shipping Label Generation:** Trigger the generation of a shipping label in a separate process.\n * **Notification to Warehouse:** Send a message to the warehouse management system to pick and pack the order.\n\n* **Benefits:** The website remains responsive even if payment processing or inventory updates take some time. The customer immediately receives a confirmation page.\n\n**2. Image/Video Processing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A user uploads an image or video to a social media platform.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Thumbnail Generation:** Generate multiple thumbnails of different sizes.\n * **Video Encoding:** Encode the video in different formats for various devices.\n * **Content Moderation:** Analyze the image/video for inappropriate content.\n * **Indexing:** Add the image/video to the search index.\n\n* **Benefits:** The user doesn\u0027t have to wait for all the processing to complete before seeing the image/video on their profile. The platform can handle a large number of uploads efficiently.\n\n**3. User Account Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A user signs up for a new account on a website.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Welcome Email:** Queue a task to send a welcome email.\n * **Data Analysis:** Trigger a task to analyze the new user\u0027s information (e.g., location, interests) for marketing purposes.\n * **Profile Creation:** Create a default user profile with initial settings.\n\n* **Benefits:** The user can access the website immediately after submitting the registration form.\n\n**4. Data Backup and Archiving:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Regularly backing up database data.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Data Dump:** Initiate a database dump to a storage location.\n * **Data Compression:** Compress the backup data to save storage space.\n * **Data Transfer:** Transfer the compressed backup to an offsite location.\n * **Archiving:** Archive older data to less expensive storage.\n\n* **Benefits:** The backup process doesn\u0027t interfere with the regular operation of the database. Large datasets can be backed up without impacting performance.\n\n**5. Scientific Simulations:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Running complex simulations, such as climate models or protein folding.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Dividing the Simulation:** Break down the simulation into smaller, independent tasks.\n * **Distribution to Compute Nodes:** Distribute these tasks to multiple compute nodes or servers.\n * **Data Aggregation:** Collect the results from each node and aggregate them into a final result.\n\n* **Benefits:** The simulation can be run in parallel, significantly reducing the overall execution time.\n\n**6. IOT (Internet of Things) Data Processing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Receiving data from thousands of sensors.\n\n* **Asynchronous Tasks:**\n\n * **Data Ingestion:** Receive sensor data and store it in a message queue or data lake.\n * **Data Validation:** Validate the sensor data for errors or inconsistencies.\n * **Data Transformation:** Transform the data into a usable format.\n * **Alerting:** Trigger alerts based on sensor data thresholds.\n * **Analytics:** Perform analytics on the sensor data to identify trends and patterns.\n\n* **Benefits:** The system can handle a high volume of data from numerous sensors without being overwhelmed. Real-time alerts can be generated based on incoming data.\n\n**Key Technologies for Implementing Asynchronous Workflows:**\n\n* **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS):** Used to decouple tasks and ensure reliable delivery.\n* **Task Queues (e.g., Celery, Sidekiq, AWS SQS with Lambda):** Provide a framework for managing and executing asynchronous tasks.\n* **Event-Driven Architectures:** Build systems based on the publish-subscribe pattern.\n* **Webhooks:** Allow applications to receive notifications about events happening in other applications.\n* **Background Jobs:** Execute long-running tasks in the background without blocking the main thread.\n* **Workflow Engines (e.g., Apache Airflow, AWS Step Functions):** Orchestrate complex workflows with dependencies between tasks.\n\nThese examples illustrate how asynchronous workflows can improve the responsiveness, scalability, and fault tolerance of various applications. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, independent units, systems can handle a higher volume of requests and provide a better user experience. Remember to choose the right tools and technologies based on the specific requirements of your workflow.\n", "Mistral": "Asynchronous workflows are processes where tasks can be executed independently of each other, often in parallel, without waiting for the completion of previous tasks.
