  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Conducting a mixed methods systematic review requires a comprehensive search strategy that captures both quantitative and qualitative studies. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to assist you in your search process:\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Research Question\nClearly articulate your research question using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework for quantitative studies and the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) framework for qualitative studies. \n\n### Step 2: Develop Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nSpecify criteria to determine which studies to include or exclude based on:\n- Type of study (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)\n- Population characteristics\n- Interventions or phenomena of interest\n- Outcomes of interest\n- Date range (if applicable)\n- Language of publication\n\n### Step 3: Identify Relevant Databases\nUtilize multiple databases to ensure a comprehensive search. Some key databases include:\n- **Quantitative Studies**: \n  - PubMed\n  - Cochrane Library\n  - CINAHL\n  - PsycINFO\n  - Scopus\n  - Web of Science\n  \n- **Qualitative Studies**:\n  - Sociological Abstracts\n  - Qualitative Health Research\n  - ERIC (for education-related studies)\n  - JSTOR (broad coverage, including qualitative research)\n\n### Step 4: Construct Your Search Strategy\nCreate search strings that combine keywords and controlled vocabulary terms (such as MeSH terms in PubMed) for both quantitative and qualitative studies. Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.\n\n#### Example Search Strategy\nFor a hypothetical topic on the experiences of patients undergoing a specific treatment:\n- **Quantitative Searches**: \n  - (\u201CPatients\u201D OR \u201CParticipants\u201D) AND (\u201CTreatment\u201D OR \u201CIntervention\u201D) AND (\u201COutcome\u201D OR \u201CEffectiveness\u201D)\n  \n- **Qualitative Searches**:\n  - (\u201CPatients\u2019 experiences\u201D OR \u201CQualitative study\u201D OR \u201CThematic analysis\u201D OR \u201CFocus groups\u201D) AND (\u201CTreatment\u201D OR \u201CIntervention\u201D)\n\n### Step 5: Conduct the Search\nRun your search in the identified databases, using the constructed search strategies. Export results and filter duplicates.\n\n### Step 6: Screen Studies for Inclusion\n- **Title and Abstract Screening**: Review the titles and abstracts to identify studies that meet your inclusion criteria.\n- **Full-Text Screening**: Obtain and review the full text of the potentially relevant studies to determine final inclusion.\n\n### Step 7: Data Extraction\nDevelop a data extraction form to capture relevant information from each included study, such as:\n- Bibliographic details\n- Study design and methods\n- Sample size and characteristics\n- Intervention details\n- Outcomes measured\n- Key findings\n\n### Step 8: Quality Assessment\nAssess the quality and rigor of the included studies using appropriate tools:\n- For quantitative studies, use tools like the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool or the Jadad Scale.\n- For qualitative studies, consider using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist or other qualitative assessment frameworks.\n\n### Step 9: Synthesize Findings\nPerform a synthesis of the findings from both quantitative and qualitative studies. This can involve:\n- Narrative synthesis\n- Thematic analysis for qualitative data\n- Meta-analysis for quantitative studies (if applicable)\n\n### Step 10: Report Your Findings\nWrite up your systematic review including the methodology, results, discussion, and conclusions. Ensure adherence to reporting guidelines such as PRISMA for systematic reviews.\n\n### Tips:\n- Keep a detailed record of your search process to enhance transparency and reproducibility.\n- Consult with a librarian or information specialist who can assist in database searches and refine your strategy.\n- Stay organized using reference management software like EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to conduct a comprehensive mixed methods systematic review that effectively captures the relevant literature in your field of study. Good luck!", "Grok": "### Conducting a Mixed Methods Systematic Review: Searching for Quantitative and Qualitative Studies\n\nA mixed methods systematic review synthesizes evidence from both quantitative (e.g., experimental, observational studies like RCTs or cohort studies) and qualitative (e.g., interviews, ethnographies) research to provide a comprehensive understanding of a topic. The search process follows similar principles to a standard systematic review but requires strategies to capture diverse study designs. I\u0027ll guide you step by step, focusing on your query about searching for both types of studies. This draws from established frameworks like PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and guidance from the Cochrane Collaboration and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for mixed methods reviews.\n\n#### 1. **Define Your Research Question and Inclusion Criteria**\n   - Start with a clear, inclusive question using a framework like PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) for quantitative aspects, combined with SPICE (Setting, Perspective, Intervention, Comparison, Evaluation) for qualitative ones. For mixed methods, adapt to PICoS or similar to encompass both.\n     - Example: If reviewing interventions for mental health in workplaces, specify: \u0022What are the quantitative effects and qualitative experiences of mindfulness programs (I) on employee stress (O) in corporate settings (S)?\u0022\n   - Develop eligibility criteria:\n     - **Quantitative**: RCTs, quasi-experimental, surveys with numerical data.\n     - **Qualitative**: Thematic analyses, grounded theory, narrative studies.\n     - **Mixed**: Studies combining both (e.g., convergent designs).\n     - Exclude: Opinion pieces, editorials; include gray literature if relevant.\n   - Tip: Use tools like Covidence or Rayyan for screening later.\n\n#### 2. **Develop a Comprehensive Search Strategy**\n   - **Key Principle**: Design a sensitive search (broad to avoid missing studies) that doesn\u0027t overly restrict by method type upfront. Instead, filter post-search. Search for both paradigms simultaneously to ensure overlap and efficiency.\n   - **Identify Databases**: Cover biomedical, social sciences, and multidisciplinary sources to capture both types.\n     - Quantitative-focused: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CINAHL (for nursing/health), Cochrane Library, Web of Science.\n     - Qualitative-focused: PsycINFO, ERIC (education), Sociological Abstracts, Anthropology Plus.\n     - Multidisciplinary: Scopus, Google Scholar (for gray literature), ProQuest Dissertations.\n     - Specialized for mixed methods: JBI Database of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Collaboration.\n   - **Search Terms and Boolean Logic**:\n     - Break into concepts: Population \u002B Intervention/Exposure \u002B Outcome \u002B Study Design (optional).\n     - Use MeSH/Emtree terms for controlled vocabulary (e.g., in PubMed: \u0022Mindfulness\u0022[Mesh] AND \u0022Workplace\u0022[Mesh]).\n     - Combine quantitative and qualitative filters sparingly\u2014run broad searches first.\n       - Broad example: (\u0022mindfulness\u0022 OR \u0022meditation\u0022) AND (\u0022workplace\u0022 OR \u0022employee\u0022) AND (\u0022stress\u0022 OR \u0022burnout\u0022).\n     - Quantitative-specific terms (add if needed): \u0022randomized controlled trial\u0022 OR \u0022cohort study\u0022 OR \u0022RCT\u0022 OR \u0022quantitative\u0022 OR \u0022experimental\u0022.\n     - Qualitative-specific terms: \u0022qualitative research\u0022 OR \u0022interview\u0022 OR \u0022focus group\u0022 OR \u0022thematic analysis\u0022 OR \u0022phenomenology\u0022.\n     - For mixed: \u0022mixed methods\u0022 OR \u0022convergent design\u0022 OR \u0022embedded\u0022.\n     - Use operators: AND (narrows), OR (broadens), NOT (excludes, e.g., NOT \u0022animal\u0022).\n     - Handle synonyms: Use truncation (e.g., qualitativ*) and proximity searching (e.g., \u0022workplace NEAR/5 stress\u0022).\n   - **Limits and Filters**: Date range (e.g., 2000\u2013present), language (e.g., English), peer-reviewed. Avoid method filters initially to prevent bias\u2014screen abstracts manually.\n   - Tip: Create a search log (e.g., in Excel) tracking terms, databases, hits, and dates for reproducibility. Aim for 1,000\u20135,000 initial results depending on scope.\n\n#### 3. **Execute and Document the Search**\n   - **Run Searches**: Start with 2\u20133 core databases, then expand. Export results to EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley for deduplication.\n     - Example PubMed Search (adapt to your topic):\n       \u0060\u0060\u0060\n       (\u0022mindfulness\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR mindfulness OR meditation) AND (\u0022workplace\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR employee OR occupational) AND (stress[MeSH Terms] OR burnout OR anxiety) AND (2000:2023[pdat])\n       \u0060\u0060\u0060\n       - For qualitative subset: Add \u0060(\u0022Qualitative Research\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR qualitative OR interview OR \u0022focus groups\u0022)\u0060.\n   - **Gray Literature and Hand-Searching**:\n     - Include theses (ProQuest), conference abstracts (e.g., via Google Scholar alerts), policy reports (e.g., WHO, government sites), and preprints (medRxiv, SSRN).\n     - Hand-search key journals (e.g., Qualitative Health Research for qual; BMJ for quant) and reference lists of included studies (snowballing).\n     - Contact experts or authors for unpublished work.\n   - **International Scope**: Search non-English databases if relevant (e.g., LILACS for Latin America) and translate as needed.\n   - Time Estimate: 1\u20132 weeks for initial searches; involve a librarian for optimization.\n\n#### 4. **Screen and Select Studies**\n   - **Deduplicate**: Use software to remove ~20\u201330% duplicates.\n   - **Screening Process** (Two-Reviewer Rule for Rigor):\n     - Title/Abstract: Exclude obvious non-matches; aim for 10\u201320% full-text advancement.\n     - Full-Text: Assess against criteria\u2014tag as quantitative, qualitative, or mixed.\n     - Resolve Disagreements: Discuss or use a third reviewer.\n   - **PRISMA Flow Diagram**: Document at each stage (e.g., records identified, screened, included).\n   - Challenges in Mixed Methods: Qualitative studies may be harder to find due to indexing biases\u2014supplement with targeted qual databases.\n\n#### 5. **Quality Appraisal and Synthesis**\n   - While not directly your query, note for completeness:\n     - Quantitative: Use tools like ROBINS-I or AMSTAR.\n     - Qualitative: CASP or JBI checklists.\n     - Mixed: MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool) for integrated assessment.\n   - Synthesis: Narrative for qual, meta-analysis for quant if possible; convergent synthesis for mixed (e.g., joint display of findings).\n\n#### Common Pitfalls and Tips\n- **Bias Risk**: Over-relying on quantitative databases misses qual depth\u2014balance your strategy.\n- **Scope Creep**: Pilot your search on a small scale to refine terms.\n- **Resources**: Consult PRISMA-ScR extension for scoping/mixed reviews, or the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Tools like ASReview (AI-assisted screening) can speed things up.\n- **Ethics**: Register your protocol on PROSPERO if health-related.\n\nIf you provide more details (e.g., your topic or specific databases), I can refine this guidance further. What\u0027s next in your process?", "Mistral": "Conducting a mixed methods systematic review involves integrating both quantitative and qualitative studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of a research topic. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you search for both types of studies:\n\n### 1.
