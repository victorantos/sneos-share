  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Administering brief surveys before and after focus groups can be a great way to gather quantitative data that complements your qualitative insights. Here\u2019s how you can go about it:\n\n### 1. Designing the Surveys\n\n**Pre-Survey (Before the Focus Group)**\n\n**Objective:** To gauge participants\u0027 current knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors regarding the topic of discussion.\n\n**Suggested Questions:**\n- **Demographics (if relevant)**\n  - Age: ____\n  - Gender: ____\n  - Occupation: ____\n  \n- **Knowledge/Attitude/Behavior (Likert Scale)** (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)\n  - I feel knowledgeable about [topic].\n  - I believe [topic] is important/impactful.\n  - I have taken actions related to [topic] in the past month.\n  \n- **Open-ended Question**\n  - What is your current understanding of [topic]?\n\n**Post-Survey (After the Focus Group)**\n\n**Objective:** To measure any changes in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors after the discussion.\n\n**Suggested Questions:**\n- **Demographics (if relevant)**\n  - Age: ____\n  - Gender: ____\n  - Occupation: ____\n\n- **Knowledge/Attitude/Behavior (Likert Scale)** (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)\n  - I feel more knowledgeable about [topic] after this focus group.\n  - I would encourage others to consider [topic] based on our discussion.\n  - I plan to take action related to [topic] in the next month.\n\n- **Open-ended Question**\n  - What key insights did you gain from this focus group?\n\n### 2. Administering the Surveys\n\n**Timing:**\n- Distribute the pre-survey before the focus group begins. Allow participants around 5-10 minutes to complete it.\n- Administer the post-survey immediately after the focus group ends, also allowing around 5-10 minutes for completion.\n\n**Format:**\n- Use paper surveys or digital platforms (like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or Microsoft Forms) depending on what is most convenient for the participants.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Clearly explain the purpose of the surveys.\n- Assure confidentiality and the use of results only for research purposes.\n- Encourage honest and thoughtful responses.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Collected Data\n\n**Quantitative Analysis:**\n- Calculate mean scores for Likert scale questions and compare pre/post results. You can use t-tests or paired sample tests to determine statistically significant changes.\n  \n**Qualitative Analysis:**\n- Conduct a thematic analysis of open-ended responses to identify key themes and insights from participants\u0027 reflections.\n\n### 4. Reporting Findings\n\n- Present your findings in a clear format, combining quantitative data (charts and graphs) with qualitative insights (quotes and themes).\n- Discuss implications and observations based on the comparisons between pre- and post-surveys.\n\nThis structured approach should help you effectively measure and analyze the impact of the focus groups on participants.", "Gemini": "This is a fantastic approach to leverage the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative data! Administering brief pre/post surveys effectively is crucial for connecting individual-level changes to the focus group experience.\n\nHere\u0027s a detailed guide to help you administer these surveys smoothly:\n\n---\n\n## Administering Brief Pre/Post Surveys for Focus Groups\n\nThe goal is to capture participant\u0027s attitudes, knowledge, or perceptions *before* the discussion and then *immediately after* the discussion, linking each participant\u0027s pre-response to their post-response and their contributions in the focus group.\n\n### I. Survey Design (Pre-Requisite)\n\nBefore you administer, ensure your surveys are well-designed:\n\n1.  **Brevity is Key:**\n    *   Aim for **2-5 minutes maximum** per survey. Any longer, and you risk participant fatigue, rushed answers, or drop-offs.\n    *   Limit the number of questions to only the most critical variables you want to measure pre/post.\n\n2.  **Parallel Structure for Core Questions:**\n    *   The **key questions** you want to track for change **MUST be identical** in both the pre and post-survey.\n    *   Use consistent question wording, response scales (e.g., 5-point Likert scale from \u0022Strongly Disagree\u0022 to \u0022Strongly Agree\u0022).\n\n3.  **Content Suggestions:**\n    *   **Pre-Survey:**\n        *   **Unique Identifier:** This is CRITICAL. See point #4 below.\n        *   **Demographics:** Briefly capture essential demographics (e.g., age range, gender, profession) needed for your analysis. Keep this minimal.\n        *   **Core Metrics (Likert/Scaled):** Questions about their current attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, intentions, or comfort levels related to your focus group topic.\n        *   *(Optional)* One open-ended question: \u0022What is your main hope or expectation for this discussion today?\u0022 (Very brief answer expected).\n    *   **Post-Survey:**\n        *   **Unique Identifier:** Again, CRITICAL. It *must* be the same code they used in the pre-survey.\n        *   **Core Metrics (Likert/Scaled):** The *exact same* questions as the pre-survey.\n        *   *(Optional)* One or two specific questions about the focus group experience itself (e.g., \u0022How valuable did you find the discussion?\u0022, \u0022Did the discussion change your perspective?\u0022).\n        *   *(Optional)* One open-ended question: \u0022What is your main takeaway or most significant thought after today\u0027s discussion?\u0022 (Brief answer expected).\n\n4.  **The Unique Identifier (The Most Important Part):**\n    *   You need a way to link a participant\u0027s pre-survey, their focus group contributions, and their post-survey.\n    *   **Method:** Generate a simple, non-identifying code for each participant.\n        *   **Option A (Best for Online/Pre-Assigned):** Assign each participant a unique code (e.g., FG1-P01, FG1-P02...) *before* they join the focus group. Send it to them in their invitation or reminder. They will enter this code into both surveys.\n        *   **Option B (Good for In-Person/On-the-Spot):**\n            *   Give them a physical slip of paper with a unique code on it when they arrive. They keep this slip.\n            *   Alternatively, instruct them to create a code based on a simple formula that *only they know* and that is *unlikely to be duplicated* (e.g., \u0022Last 2 digits of your birth year \u002B First 2 letters of your mother\u0027s maiden name\u0022). This method requires very clear instructions and careful management, and some risk of duplication or forgetting. *Pre-assigned codes are generally more reliable.*\n    *   **Instructions for Participants:** Clearly explain *why* they need this code (to link their responses for research purposes, not for personal identification) and that it helps ensure their confidentiality.\n\n### II. Pre-Administration Setup\n\n1.  **Choose Your Platform:**\n    *   **Online Survey Tool:** Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, Typeform are excellent choices. They automate data collection and make analysis easier.\n        *   *Pros:* Easy to distribute links, data automatically compiled, can use branching logic.\n        *   *Cons:* Requires participants to have a device and internet access, potential tech issues.\n    *   **Paper Surveys:**\n        *   *Pros:* No tech required, good for less tech-savvy groups, ensures everyone completes on the spot.\n        *   *Cons:* Manual data entry needed (prone to error, time-consuming), can be difficult to track unique IDs without physical slips.\n\n2.  **Test Thoroughly:**\n    *   Fill out both surveys yourself multiple times.\n    *   Check for clarity, typos, logical flow, and ensure all questions are mandatory (if desired) and response types are correct.\n    *   Test the unique identifier field.\n\n3.  **Prepare Instructions:**\n    *   Draft clear, concise instructions for participants on *how* and *when* to complete each survey, and *why* it\u0027s important (emphasizing confidentiality).\n    *   Include clear instructions on using/creating/remembering their unique identifier.\n\n4.  **Logistics:**\n    *   **Online FG:** Have survey links ready to paste into the chat.\n    *   **In-person FG:**\n        *   If using digital: Prepare QR codes or short URLs. Consider having a few tablets available for those without smartphones/access, or ensure good Wi-Fi.\n        *   If using paper: Prepare enough copies, pens, and clipboards. Designate a secure collection spot.\n\n### III. During Administration (Pre-Focus Group Survey)\n\n1.  **Welcome \u0026 Context:**\n    *   As participants arrive (in-person) or log in (online), welcome them.\n    *   Explain the agenda briefly, starting with the survey.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Survey (Script Example):**\n    *   \u0022Thank you all for being here. Before we dive into our discussion, we have a very brief survey we\u0027d like you to complete. This survey takes about 2-3 minutes and will help us understand your initial thoughts on [Topic] *before* our group discussion. We\u0027ll ask you a similar set of questions again at the very end.\u0022\n\n3.  **Explain the Unique Identifier (CRITICAL):**\n    *   \u0022To help us connect your \u0027before\u0027 and \u0027after\u0027 thoughts, we\u0027ll be using a unique participant code. This code doesn\u0027t identify you personally but helps us link your survey responses for our research. **Please make sure to use the exact same code you used today in the post-survey.**\u0022\n    *   *If pre-assigned:* \u0022You should have received your unique code [e.g., in your invitation email/on the slip I\u0027m handing you]. Please enter that code now.\u0022\n    *   *If self-generated:* \u0022For this code, please use [e.g., the last two digits of your birth year \u002B the first two letters of your mother\u0027s maiden name, all lowercase]. Please write this code down somewhere so you don\u0027t forget it for the post-survey.\u0022\n\n4.  **Distribute/Share the Survey:**\n    *   **Online:** \u0022I\u0027m sharing the link in the chat now. Please click on it and complete the survey.\u0022 (Paste link).\n    *   **In-person (digital):** \u0022Here\u0027s a QR code you can scan, or I can give you the short URL. If you don\u0027t have a device, we have a few tablets available.\u0022\n    *   **In-person (paper):** \u0022Please take a clipboard, pen, and a survey sheet. Remember to fill in your unique code at the top.\u0022\n\n5.  **Monitor \u0026 Time:**\n    *   Announce: \u0022Please let me know when you\u0027ve finished.\u0022\n    *   Allow adequate quiet time. If someone finishes quickly, ask them to wait patiently.\n    *   Gently prompt anyone who seems to be taking too long. \u0022Just a reminder, this survey should only take a couple of minutes.\u0022\n\n6.  **Collection/Confirmation:**\n    *   **Online:** \u0022Great, thank you everyone. I see most people have submitted. If you haven\u0027t, please do so now.\u0022\n    *   **In-person (digital):** \u0022Thank you. You can put your devices away now.\u0022\n    *   **In-person (paper):** \u0022When you\u0027re finished, please place your completed survey face down in this [designated box/tray].\u0022\n\n### IV. During Administration (Post-Focus Group Survey)\n\n1.  **Immediate Post-Discussion:**\n    *   As soon as the focus group discussion officially ends, before any informal chat or wrap-up begins, introduce the post-survey.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Survey (Script Example):**\n    *   \u0022Thank you for that incredibly rich discussion! Before you go, we have one final, very brief survey to complete. This survey asks similar questions to the one you completed earlier and should only take about 2-3 minutes. Your responses here are vital for us to understand any shifts in your thinking after our conversation.\u0022\n\n3.  **Re-iterate the Unique Identifier (CRITICAL):**\n    *   \u0022Just like before, **please use the exact same unique participant code** you used for the pre-survey. This helps us connect your \u0027before\u0027 and \u0027after\u0027 responses.\u0022\n    *   *If self-generated, remind them of the formula:* \u0022Remember, that was [e.g., last two digits of birth year \u002B first two letters of mother\u0027s maiden name].\u0022\n\n4.  **Distribute/Share the Survey:**\n    *   Use the same method as the pre-survey (chat link, QR code, paper).\n\n5.  **Monitor \u0026 Time:**\n    *   Again, allow quiet time. Participants might be eager to leave, so keep them focused and emphasize the brevity.\n    *   Be prepared for a few to forget their code. Reassure them to do their best to remember or approximate it. If they truly can\u0027t, still have them complete the survey, but note the missing/incomplete ID.\n\n6.  **Collection/Confirmation \u0026 Final Thank You:**\n    *   \u0022Thank you everyone for completing the final survey. Your participation today, both in the discussion and in these surveys, has been incredibly valuable to our research. We truly appreciate your time and insights. [Provide any closing instructions, e.g., \u0027Feel free to leave now\u0027 or \u0027We have some refreshments available\u0027].\u0022\n\n### V. Post-Administration \u0026 Data Management\n\n1.  **Link Data:**\n    *   The first and most important step is to match pre-surveys to post-surveys using the unique identifier.\n    *   Create a master spreadsheet where each row is a participant, and you have columns for their unique ID, pre-survey responses, post-survey responses, and potentially notes from their focus group participation (e.g., their pseudonym used in the transcript).\n\n2.  **Anonymize/Confidentialize:**\n    *   Once data is linked, replace the unique participant codes with generic internal IDs (e.g., Participant A, Participant B) to further protect confidentiality during analysis.\n    *   Ensure any qualitative data (focus group transcripts) are also linked using these internal IDs.\n\n3.  **Data Analysis:**\n    *   You can now perform quantitative analysis on the pre/post survey data (e.g., paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to see if there\u0027s a significant change).\n    *   Integrate this with your qualitative analysis, using the survey data to inform which segments of the FG transcript to look at more closely, or using FG insights to explain *why* survey scores changed (or didn\u0027t).\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you\u0027ll ensure a robust data collection process that maximizes the benefits of your mixed-methods approach!", "Mistral": "Certainly! Administering brief surveys before and after a focus group can provide valuable insights into participants\u0027 perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you administer these surveys effectively:\n\n### Step 1: Design the Surveys\n\n#### Pre-Focus Group Survey\n- **Purpose**: To gather baseline data on participants\u0027 knowledge, attitudes, and expectations.\n- **Content**:\n  - Demographic questions (age, gender, occupation, etc.)\n  - Questions about prior knowledge or experience related to the focus group topic.\n  - Questions about expectations and goals for the focus group.\n  - Open-ended questions to capture initial thoughts or concerns.\n\n#### Post-Focus Group Survey\n- **Purpose**: To assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions after the focus group.\n- **Content**:\n  - Questions about what participants learned or gained from the focus group.\n  - Questions about any changes in attitudes or perceptions.\n  - Feedback on the focus group process (e.g., facilitation, group dynamics, etc.)\n  - Open-ended questions to capture final thoughts or suggestions.\n\n### Step 2: Prepare the Surveys\n\n#### Format\n- **Paper Surveys**: Easy to distribute and collect, but require manual data entry.\n- **Online Surveys**: Use tools like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or Qualtrics for easy distribution and automatic data collection.\n\n#### Length\n- Keep the surveys brief to ensure high completion rates.
