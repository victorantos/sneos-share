Doesn\u0027t involve any system downtime.\n * **Example:** Reviewing the contact list to ensure all phone numbers and email addresses are current.\n* **Walkthrough Test (Tabletop Exercise):**\n * **Description:** A simulated disaster scenario where IT staff and business users walk through the recovery process step-by-step.\n * **Focus:** Validating the roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and decision-making processes outlined in the DR plan.\n * **Impact:** Low impact. Doesn\u0027t involve any system downtime.\n * **Example:** Gathering key personnel in a room to discuss how they would respond to a simulated ransomware attack, following the steps in the DR plan.\n* **Simulation Test:**\n * **Description:** A more advanced test that involves simulating a disaster scenario in a test environment.\n * **Focus:** Verifying the functionality of recovery systems and applications, as well as the effectiveness of data replication and backup processes.\n * **Impact:** Low to medium impact. May involve some downtime in the test environment.\n * **Example:** Simulating a server failure in a test environment and testing the failover to a backup server.\n* **Parallel Test:**\n * **Description:** A full-scale test where the DR systems are brought online in parallel with the production systems. Data is restored to the DR environment and validated, while production systems continue to operate.\n * **Focus:** Validating the functionality of the DR systems without impacting the production environment.\n * **Impact:** Medium impact. Minimal disruption to production, but requires significant resources.\n * **Example:** Restoring data to the DR environment and running reports from the DR systems to verify data integrity, while the production systems continue to process transactions.\n* **Cutover Test (Full Interruption Test):**\n * **Description:** The most comprehensive test, where the production systems are shut down and the DR systems are brought online to take over all operations.\n * **Focus:** Validating the entire DR plan and ensuring that all critical business functions can be restored in the DR environment.\n * **Impact:** High impact. Involves significant downtime and requires careful planning and coordination. This should be planned well in advance.\n * **Example:** Shutting down the primary data center and failing over all applications and data to the secondary data center.\n\n**Key Steps in DR Testing:**\n\n1. **Define Scope and Objectives:** Determine which systems and applications will be included in the test, what specific objectives you want to achieve (e.g., verify RTO, validate data integrity), and the type of test to be performed.\n2. **Develop a Test Plan:** Create a detailed test plan that outlines the test procedures, roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and success criteria.\n3. **Prepare the Test Environment:** Ensure that the test environment is properly configured and isolated from the production environment.
