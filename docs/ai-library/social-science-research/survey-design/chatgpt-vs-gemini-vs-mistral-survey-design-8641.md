  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "It\u0027s great that you are taking a proactive approach to study college student mental health and service utilization. Below are detailed steps and suggestions for each aspect of your inquiry.\n\n### 1) Develop Research Questions and Hypotheses\n\n**Research Questions:**\n- What is the prevalence of depression and anxiety among college students?\n- What percentage of college students utilize mental health services on campus or in the community?\n- What factors (e.g., demographic characteristics, academic stress, social support) are associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety?\n- How do barriers to access influence service utilization among college students facing mental health challenges?\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n- H1: A higher prevalence of depressive symptoms will be associated with lower rates of service utilization.\n- H2: Students with higher levels of anxiety will report more barriers to accessing mental health services.\n- H3: Demographic factors (e.g., gender, year in school, living situation) will show significant differences in mental health symptoms and service utilization.\n\n### 2) Select Validated Scales\n\n- **PHQ-9**: A 9-item scale for measuring the severity of depression. This scale has been validated for use in diverse populations, including college students.\n- **GAD-7**: A 7-item scale for measuring the severity of generalized anxiety disorder. This is also validated for varied populations.\n\n### 3) Write Clear, Unbiased Questions\n\n**Demographics:**\n- What is your age?\n- What is your gender? (Options: Male, Female, Non-binary/Third Gender, Prefer not to say)\n- What year are you in college? (Options: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate)\n- What is your major field of study?\n\n**Mental Health Assessment:**\n- Please rate how often you have been bothered by the following problems over the past two weeks: (Use PHQ-9 and GAD-7 items)\n  1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things (PHQ-9)\n  2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (PHQ-9)\n  3. Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much (PHQ-9)\n  ...\n  (Subsequently ask GAD-7 items in a similar structure)\n\n**Service Utilization:**\n- Have you ever sought help for mental health issues? (Options: Yes, No)\n- If yes, what services did you utilize? (Options: Counseling center, Private therapist, Peer support, etc.)\n- What barriers, if any, have you encountered when seeking mental health services? (Multiple choice: Lack of time, Stigma, Financial reasons, etc.)\n\n### 4) Design Skip Logic and Branching\n\n- If participants answer \u201CNo\u201D to having sought help for mental health issues, skip to questions about potential barriers.\n- If they answer \u201CYes,\u201D present follow-up questions about the types of services utilized and satisfaction levels with those services.\n- Use branching for demographic questions to gather more specific data based on initial responses (e.g., if \u201COther\u201D is selected for gender, prompt for specification).\n\n### 5) Determine Sampling Strategy and Recruitment\n\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n- Use a stratified random sampling approach to ensure diversity in demographics (e.g., gender, year in college, major).\n- Collaborate with university administration to reach students via email or through student organizations.\n\n**Recruitment:**\n- Create an engaging participant recruitment message that highlights the importance of mental health awareness.\n- Offer incentives (e.g., raffle for gift cards or wellness resources) to encourage participation.\n\n### 6) Calculate Response Rates Needed\n\n- To achieve a target sample size of 500, calculate the minimum number of students you need to survey to account for expected non-response.\n- Assuming a conservative response rate of 20%, you would need to reach approximately 2500 students (500 / 0.2).\n\n### 7) Plan Survey Distribution (Qualtrics)\n\n- Develop the survey in Qualtrics with all the questions organized in logical order.\n- Test the survey with a small pilot group to identify any issues with question clarity or functionality before full distribution.\n- Distribute the survey via university email and social media, along with links in relevant student organizations.\n\n### 8) Draft IRB Protocol\n\n**Title:**\nSurvey of College Students\u2019 Mental Health and Service Utilization.\n\n**Purpose:**\nTo assess the prevalence of mental health symptoms and the utilization of mental health services among college students.\n\n**Participants:**\n500 college students aged 18 years and older from (insert university name).\n\n**Procedure:**\nParticipants will complete a web-based survey using Qualtrics, which will take approximately 15 minutes.\n\n**Confidentiality:**\nAll responses will be anonymized, and data will be stored securely. Only aggregated results will be reported.\n\n**Risks:**\nMinimal risk associated with discussing mental health; participants can skip questions or withdraw at any time.\n\n**Benefits:**\nFindings may contribute to improved mental health services and resources at the university.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you will develop a comprehensive survey that addresses critical aspects of mental health and service utilization among college students. Make sure to follow ethical guidelines throughout the research process and adjust the survey as needed based on pilot testing. Good luck with your study!", "Gemini": "This is a comprehensive request, and designing such a survey requires careful planning across multiple domains. Let\u0027s break it down step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n## College Student Mental Health and Service Utilization Survey Design\n\n**Target N = 500**\n\n### 1) Research Questions and Hypotheses\n\n**Overarching Research Goal:** To understand the prevalence of mental health challenges among college students, their attitudes towards and utilization of mental health services, and the perceived barriers to seeking help.\n\n**Research Questions (RQs):**\n\n1.  What is the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety among college students?\n    *   *Sub-question:* Do demographic factors (e.g., gender identity, race/ethnicity, academic year) moderate the prevalence of these symptoms?\n2.  What is the level of perceived stress among college students?\n    *   *Sub-question:* How does perceived stress correlate with symptoms of depression and anxiety?\n3.  What is the current rate of mental health service utilization among college students?\n    *   *Sub-question:* What types of services are most frequently accessed (e.g., on-campus counseling, off-campus therapy, informal support)?\n4.  What are the primary perceived barriers that prevent college students from seeking mental health support?\n    *   *Sub-question:* Do these barriers differ based on symptom severity or demographic characteristics?\n5.  What are college students\u0027 attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help and their perceptions of mental health stigma?\n    *   *Sub-question:* How do attitudes and stigma relate to service utilization?\n6.  How do mental health symptoms impact academic performance and social functioning?\n\n**Hypotheses (Hs):**\n\n1.  **H1 (Prevalence):** A significant proportion of college students (e.g., \u003E30%) will report clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 score \u2265 10) and anxiety (GAD-7 score \u2265 10).\n    *   **H1a:** Students identifying as a gender minority or racial/ethnic minority will report higher rates of depression and anxiety symptoms.\n2.  **H2 (Stress-Symptom Link):** There will be a positive correlation between perceived stress levels (PSS-10) and the severity of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms.\n3.  **H3 (Utilization):** Less than 50% of students reporting clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety will have utilized formal mental health services in the past 12 months.\n    *   **H3a:** On-campus counseling services will be the most frequently utilized formal mental health resource.\n4.  **H4 (Barriers):** Perceived stigma and financial cost will be among the most frequently endorsed barriers to seeking mental health services.\n    *   **H4a:** Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will report financial cost as a more significant barrier.\n5.  **H5 (Attitudes \u0026 Utilization):** More positive attitudes towards seeking professional help and lower perceived stigma will be associated with a higher likelihood of mental health service utilization.\n6.  **H6 (Impact):** Students with higher scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 will report a greater negative impact of their mental health on their academic performance and social interactions.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Selected Validated Scales\n\nIn addition to your chosen scales, I recommend a few others to address the full scope of your research questions.\n\n1.  **Depression:** **Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)**\n    *   *Purpose:* Screens for depression severity and probable depressive disorder.\n    *   *Number of Items:* 9\n    *   *Scoring:* 0-4 (None), 5-9 (Mild), 10-14 (Moderate), 15-19 (Moderately Severe), 20-27 (Severe). A score of 10 or greater indicates probable major depression.\n    *   *Source:* Spitzer, Williams, Kroenke (1999)\n2.  **Anxiety:** **Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)**\n    *   *Purpose:* Screens for generalized anxiety disorder severity.\n    *   *Number of Items:* 7\n    *   *Scoring:* 0-4 (Minimal), 5-9 (Mild), 10-14 (Moderate), 15-21 (Severe).

If No, skip to Section E: Barriers to Seeking Help).\n*   **Academic/Social Impact:** Follow-up questions only if the initial \u0022Yes\u0022 is selected.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Sampling Strategy and Recruitment\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Method:** A **convenience sampling** approach will likely be most feasible for reaching 500 students, supplemented by efforts to increase representativeness. While true random sampling of the entire student body can be logistically challenging and resource-intensive, we will strive for broad outreach.\n    *   **Inclusion Criteria:** Currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate student at [University Name], 18 years or older.\n    *   **Exclusion Criteria:** Students under 18 years of age.\n*   **Recruitment Strategy:**\n    1.  **University-Wide Email:** Collaborate with Student Affairs, Dean of Students, or other relevant departments to send out an official invitation email to the entire student body listserv (if permitted). This email will include a brief explanation of the study, the survey link, and information about the incentive.\n    2.  **Classroom Announcements/Faculty Endorsement:** Reach out to faculty across various departments (especially those with large undergraduate enrollments) and ask them to make brief announcements in their classes or post the survey link on their course management systems (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard). This can help reach a more diverse range of students across majors.\n    3.  **Student Organizations:** Partner with diverse student organizations (e.g., cultural groups, academic clubs, student government, wellness groups) to disseminate the survey link through their internal communications.\n    4.  **Social Media:** Post the survey link on official university social media channels (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and relevant student-run pages/groups.\n    5.  **Campus Flyers/Posters:** Distribute flyers with QR codes linked to the survey in high-traffic campus locations (e.g., library, student union, dining halls, academic buildings, residence halls).\n    6.  **Incentive:** Offer a strong incentive to encourage participation. A raffle for several **$50 gift cards** (e.g., 10-15 gift cards) or a smaller, guaranteed incentive (e.g., entry into a drawing for a $5 gift card per 50 participants) can significantly boost response rates. Participants enter the raffle by providing their email in a *separate* survey (or a separate section of the main survey that is immediately disassociated from their responses to maintain anonymity).\n\n---\n\n### 6) Response Rates Needed\n\n*   **Target Sample Size (n):** 500 complete responses.\n*   **Estimated College Survey Response Rate:** Response rates for online college student surveys vary widely depending on incentives, topic salience, and distribution method. A realistic range for a survey with incentives could be **15% to 25%**. Without strong incentives or official endorsement, it can be much lower (5-10%).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   If we aim for a **20% response rate**: To get 500 complete responses, you would need to invite approximately 500 / 0.20 = **2,500 students**.\n    *   If we aim for a **15% response rate**: To get 500 complete responses, you would need to invite approximately 500 / 0.15 = **3,333 students**.\n*   **Conclusion:** You need to reach out to a minimum of **2,500-3,500 students** through your recruitment channels to realistically achieve 500 completed surveys. This highlights the importance of using multiple recruitment strategies and official university channels.\n\n---\n\n### 7) Plan Survey Distribution (Qualtrics)\n\n1.  **Survey Creation:**\n    *   Build the survey in Qualtrics, carefully entering all questions, scales, and ensuring correct question types (e.g., multiple choice, Likert scale, open text).\n    *   Implement all specified skip logic and branching.\n    *   Add validation (e.g., force response, range validation for age) where appropriate.\n    *   Ensure all scale items are correctly coded for easy analysis later.\n2.  **Anonymity/Confidentiality Settings:**\n    *   Set the survey to **anonymous responses** by default.\n    *   If using an incentive, create a **separate Qualtrics survey link for prize entry** (which only collects email addresses) at the *end* of the main mental health survey. This ensures participant responses remain entirely separate from their identifying information for the raffle.\n3.  **Testing:**\n    *   Thoroughly test the survey multiple times from start to finish, including all skip logic and branching paths.\n    *   Have colleagues or pilot testers review for clarity, potential biases, flow, and technical issues.\n4.  **Distribution Strategy:**\n    *   **Unique Link Generation:** For broad distribution (emails, social media, flyers), generate a **single anonymous public link** for the survey.\n    *   **Email Distribution:** If an official university listserv is used, the email will include this public link. Qualtrics\u0027 internal email distributor can be used *if* you obtain a list of student emails *and* the IRB approves this method (though often external email distribution through official university channels is preferred for privacy).\n    *   **Reminder Emails:** Plan to send 2-3 reminder emails over a 2-3 week period to non-responders (if using Qualtrics\u0027 email distribution) or general reminders through university channels.\n5.  **Data Monitoring:**\n    *   Regularly monitor response rates and survey progress in Qualtrics.\n    *   Check for partial responses, data quality issues, or common drop-off points.\n6.  **Data Export:**\n    *   Upon completion of the data collection period, export the raw data from Qualtrics (e.g., CSV, SPSS format).\n    *   Ensure data is securely stored (e.g., encrypted drive, institutional research server).\n\n---\n\n### 8) Draft IRB Protocol\n\n**Institutional Review Board (IRB) Protocol: College Student Mental Health and Service Utilization**\n\n**1. Project Title:** Understanding Mental Health and Service Utilization Among College Students at [University Name]\n\n**2. Principal Investigator (PI):** [Your Name, Department, Contact Info]\n**Co-Investigators (if any):** [Name(s), Department(s), Contact Info]\n\n**3. Introduction and Background:**\nMental health challenges are prevalent among college students, with national data indicating high rates of anxiety, depression, and stress. The college years are a critical developmental period marked by unique stressors (academic pressure, financial strain, social adjustment, identity formation). Untreated mental health issues can lead to significant negative consequences, including academic failure, social isolation, and increased risk of suicide. While many institutions offer mental health services, utilization rates often remain low, suggesting barriers to access. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mental health landscape at [University Name], specifically examining the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress, current service utilization patterns, and the perceived barriers and attitudes towards seeking mental health support among our student population. The findings will inform university mental health programming and support services.\n\n**4. Research Questions \u0026 Hypotheses:** (See Section 1 above)\n\n**5. Research Design:**\nThis study employs a cross-sectional, quantitative survey design. Data will be collected through an anonymous online survey using Qualtrics.\n\n**6. Participants:**\n*   **Target Population:** Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at [University Name].\n*   **Sample Size:** N = 500 complete responses.\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:**\n    *   Currently enrolled as a student at [University Name].\n    *   18 years of age or older.\n*   **Exclusion Criteria:**\n    *   Students under 18 years of age.\n*   **Recruitment Strategy:** (See Section 5 above - copy recruitment details)\n    *   Initial invitation via university-wide email listservs (Student Affairs, Dean of Students, specific departments).\n    *   Announcements in classes (with faculty permission).\n    *   Dissemination through student organizations and official university social media channels.\n    *   Campus flyers with QR codes.\n\n**7. Procedures:**\n1.  **Recruitment:** Potential participants will receive an invitation containing a brief description of the study, an estimate of time commitment (15-20 minutes), and a direct link to the Qualtrics survey.\n2.  **Informed Consent:** Upon clicking the survey link, participants will first be presented with the online informed consent form (see Appendix A). They must actively click \u0022Yes, I agree to participate\u0022 to proceed. If they decline, the survey will terminate.\n3.  **Survey Completion:** Participants will complete the anonymous online survey, which includes demographic questions, validated mental health scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS-10, ATSPPHS-SF), and custom questions regarding service utilization, barriers, and perceived impact of mental health. Skip logic will be implemented to ensure participants only see relevant questions.\n4.  **Incentive (Optional but Recommended):** At the end of the survey, participants will be provided with a *separate link* to an optional, entirely distinct Qualtrics survey where they can provide their email address to enter a raffle for [e.g., ten $50 gift cards]. This separation ensures complete anonymity of survey responses from identifying information.\n5.  **Debriefing:** After completing the survey (and optionally, the incentive entry form), participants will be presented with a debriefing statement (see Appendix B) that thanks them for their participation, reiterates confidentiality, and provides immediate access to mental health resources on campus (e.g., Campus Counseling Center) and national crisis hotlines.\n\n**8. Measures:**\n*   **Demographics:** Age, academic year, major, gender identity, racial/ethnic identity, living situation, international student status, GPA, financial security.\n*   **PHQ-9:** Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (9 items).\n*   **GAD-7:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (7 items).\n*   **PSS-10:** Perceived Stress Scale-10 (10 items).\n*   **ATSPPHS-SF:** Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale \u2013 Short Form (10 items).\n*   **Custom Questions:** Academic/social impact of mental health, service utilization patterns, types of services used, satisfaction with services, perceived barriers to seeking help, awareness of campus resources, and open-ended feedback.\n\n**9. Data Analysis Plan:**\n*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations will be calculated to describe the demographic characteristics of the sample, prevalence of mental health symptoms, service utilization rates, and perceived barriers.\n*   **Inferential Statistics:**\n    *   **Correlations:** Pearson correlation coefficients will be used to examine relationships between continuous variables (e.g., perceived stress and symptom severity, attitudes towards help-seeking and utilization).\n    *   **Group Comparisons:** Independent samples t-tests or ANOVAs will be used to compare mental health outcomes and service utilization across different demographic groups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, academic year).\n    *   **Regression Analysis:** Logistic or linear regression may be used to identify predictors of service utilization or symptom severity based on demographic factors, perceived stress, and attitudes.\n*   **Qualitative Analysis (for open-ended):** Thematic analysis may be used to identify recurring themes in the open-ended responses.\n\n**10. Potential Risks and Benefits:**\n*   **Risks:**\n    *   **Minimal Psychological Distress:** Some questions about mental health symptoms, experiences, and barriers may evoke temporary discomfort, stress, or sadness for some participants.\n        *   **Mitigation:** The survey is anonymous. Participation is voluntary, and participants can skip any question or withdraw at any time without penalty. A comprehensive debriefing statement with immediate access to campus and national mental health resources will be provided at the end of the survey. Researchers are not therapists and will not provide direct clinical advice or intervention.\n    *   **Breach of Confidentiality/Anonymity:** Although responses are anonymous, there is a very remote theoretical risk of identification if open-ended responses contain highly specific personal details.\n        *   **Mitigation:** The survey is designed for anonymity. No direct identifying information (name, student ID) will be collected with survey responses. Email addresses for raffle entry are collected via a separate survey link and immediately disassociated from survey data. Data will be stored on secure, password-protected university servers/Qualtrics.\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   **To Participants:** May gain increased self-awareness regarding their mental health and awareness of available mental health resources. Small incentive via raffle.\n    *   **To Science/Community:** The findings will contribute to the understanding of mental health challenges, service utilization, and barriers specific to the [University Name] student population. This data can inform the development or improvement of campus mental health services, outreach programs, and support initiatives, ultimately benefiting the broader university community.\n\n**11. Confidentiality and Data Security:**\n*   All survey responses will be collected anonymously via Qualtrics. No identifying information will be linked to participant responses.\n*   Data will be stored on secure, password-protected university servers/Qualtrics, accessible only to the PI and approved research team members.\n*   Raw data files will be de-identified if any unique identifiers are inadvertently present in open-ended responses.\n*   De-identified data will be kept for [e.g., 5 years] post-publication, then securely destroyed.\n*   Any publication or presentation of results will report aggregate data, ensuring no individual participant can be identified.\n\n**12. Informed Consent Process:**\nParticipants will be presented with a detailed online informed consent form (Appendix A) at the beginning of the survey. The form will clearly outline the study\u0027s purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, confidentiality measures, voluntary nature of participation, and right to withdraw. Participants must actively click a button indicating their agreement to proceed with the survey.\n\n**13. Debriefing:**\nUpon completion of the survey, all participants will receive a debriefing statement (Appendix B) that reiterates the study\u0027s purpose, thanks them for their participation, and most importantly, provides a list of mental health resources available on campus and national crisis hotlines.\n\n**14. Compensation/Incentives:**\nParticipants who complete the survey will have the option to enter a raffle for [e.g., ten $50 gift cards]. Entry into the raffle requires providing an email address in a *separate, distinct survey* link at the end of the main study, ensuring the anonymity of their survey responses.\n\n**15.

Remember to tailor specific details (e.g., university names, specific resource contacts, raffle numbers) to your context.", "Mistral": "Sure, let\u0027s break down each step to design a comprehensive survey on college student mental health and service utilization.\n\n### 1. Develop Research Questions and Hypotheses\n\n**Research Questions:**\n1. What is the prevalence of depression and anxiety among college students?\n2. What factors are associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety among college students?\n3. How often do college students utilize mental health services?\n4. What barriers do college students face in accessing mental health services?\n5. What is the relationship between mental health service utilization and mental health outcomes?\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. College students who report higher levels of stress will also report higher levels of depression and anxiety.\n2. Students who utilize mental health services will report lower levels of depression and anxiety compared to those who do not.\n3. Barriers such as cost, stigma, and lack of awareness will be significantly associated with lower utilization of mental health services.\n\n### 2. Select Validated Scales\n\n**PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9):**\n- A 9-item scale to measure the severity of depression.\n\n**GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7):**\n- A 7-item scale to measure the severity of anxiety.\n\n### 3. Write Clear, Unbiased Questions\n\n**Demographics:**\n1. What is your age?\n2. What is your gender?\n3. What is your year of study?\n4. What is your major?\n\n**Mental Health:**\n1. How often have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things? (PHQ-9)\n2. How often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless? (PHQ-9)\n3. How often have you felt nervous, anxious, or on edge? (GAD-7)\n4. How often have you felt not being able to stop or control worrying? (GAD-7)\n\n**Service Utilization:**\n1. Have you ever used mental health services (e.g., counseling, therapy)?\n2. If yes, how often do you use these services?\n3. What barriers, if any, have you faced in accessing mental health services?\n\n### 4. Design Skip Logic and Branching\n\n**Example:**\n1. Have you ever used mental health services (e.g., counseling, therapy)?\n   - Yes\n   - No\n\n   **If Yes:**\n   - How often do you use these services?\n   - What barriers, if any, have you faced in accessing mental health services?\n\n   **If No:**\n   - What are the reasons you have not used mental health services?\n\n### 5. Determine Sampling Strategy and Recruitment\n\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n- Stratified random sampling to ensure representation from different years of study and majors.\n- Aim for a sample size of 500 students.\n\n**Recruitment:**\n- Email invitations to a random sample of students.\n- Posters and flyers around campus.\n- Social media announcements.\n- Incentives such as gift cards or entry into a prize draw.\n\n### 6. Calculate Response Rates Needed\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Target sample size: 500\n- Expected response rate: 30%\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Number of invitations needed = Target sample size / Expected response rate\n- Number of invitations needed = 500 / 0.30 = 1667\n\n### 7. Plan Survey Distribution (Qualtrics)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Create the survey in Qualtrics.\n2. Set up skip logic and branching.\n3. Test the survey with a small group of students.\n4. Distribute the survey link via email, social media, and campus announcements.\n5. Monitor responses and send reminders to non-respondents.\n\n### 8. Draft IRB Protocol\n\n**IRB Protocol Outline:**\n\n**Title:**\nSurvey on College Student Mental Health and Service Utilization\n\n**Introduction:**\n- Background and significance of the study.\n- Research questions and hypotheses.\n\n**Methods:**\n- Survey design and validated scales.\n- Sampling strategy and recruitment methods.\n- Data collection procedures.\n- Data analysis plan.\n\n**Ethical Considerations:**\n- Informed consent process.\n- Confidentiality and data security.\n- Potential risks and benefits.\n- Debriefing and support resources.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Estimated start and end dates.\n- Milestones and deadlines.\n\n**Budget:**\n- Costs associated with incentives, survey distribution, and data analysis.\n\n**Appendices:**\n- Survey instrument.\n- Informed consent form.\n- Recruitment materials.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Expected outcomes and implications.\n- Future research directions.\n\n**Submission:**\n- Submit the protocol to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval.\n\nBy following these steps, you can design a robust and ethical survey to assess college student mental health and service utilization."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
