Here\u2019s an overview of what constitutes misconduct, specifically focusing on plagiarism:\n\n### 1. **What is Plagiarism?**\nPlagiarism is the act of using someone else\u2019s work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment, thereby presenting it as your own.

While not intentional, it still holds academic consequences.\n\n### 3. **Common Sources of Plagiarism:**\n- **Books and Articles:** Not citing academic literature, journal articles, or books from which ideas or text are drawn.\n- **Internet Sources:** Using websites without proper citation, including blogs, online journals, and informational sites.\n- **Media:** Failing to attribute images, videos, or any other form of media used in projects or presentations.\n\n### 4. **How to Avoid Plagiarism:**\n- **Cite Properly:** Always provide proper citations for any material you use that is not your own, following the appropriate style guide (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).\n- **Use Quotations:** When using someone else\u2019s exact words, place them in quotation marks and give credit to the source.\n- **Paraphrase Thoughtfully:** When paraphrasing, rewrite the original text in your own words and structure, and still provide a citation.\n- **Keep Track of Sources:** Maintain a list of all sources you consult during your research to make the citation process easier.\n\n### 5. **Consequences of Plagiarism:**\nEngaging in plagiarism can lead to serious repercussions, including:\n- Academic penalties like failing the assignment, course, or even expulsion from the institution.\n- Damage to your academic reputation and career prospects.\n- Legal consequences if copyrighted material is used improperly.\n\n### 6. **Resources for Help:**\n- Most educational institutions offer resources such as writing centers, libraries, or academic integrity offices that can provide guidance on proper citation practices and how to avoid plagiarism.\n- Tools like plagiarism detection software (Turnitin, Grammarly) can be utilized to check your work for potential plagiarism before submission.\n\n### Conclusion\nUnderstanding plagiarism and adhering to ethical standards in your academic work is vital.
