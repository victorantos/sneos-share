This helps manage large datasets, especially for thematic or categorical organization. Below, I\u0027ll guide you step by step to set this up. I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re using MAXQDA 2022 or later (the interface is similar in older versions, but menus might vary slightly). If you\u0027re on an older version, let me know for adjustments.\n\n#### Step 1: Import Your Documents\nBefore organizing, you need documents in your project.\n1. Open MAXQDA and create or load your project (File \u003E New Project or Open Project).\n2. Import documents: \n   - Go to **Documents \u003E Import Documents** (or drag-and-drop files into the Document System window).\n   - Supported formats include TXT, DOCX, PDF, audio/video for transcription, etc.\n   - Import all relevant files. They\u2019ll initially appear as a flat list in the **Document System** pane (left sidebar, tab labeled \u0022Documents\u0022).\n\n#### Step 2: Open the Document System\n- Ensure the **Document System** is visible: If not, go to **View \u003E Document System** or click the Documents tab in the left pane.\n- You\u0027ll see a tree-like structure where documents are listed. By default, they\u0027re ungrouped.\n\n#### Step 3: Create Main Groups\nGroups act as top-level categories (e.g., by theme, data type, or participant group).\n1. Right-click in the empty space below the document list (or on an existing group if you want a sibling).\n2. Select **New Document Group** (or use the toolbar button: the folder icon with a \u002B).\n3. Name the group (e.g., \u0022Participant Interviews\u0022 or \u0022Themes\u0022).\n4. Repeat for as many main groups as needed. Groups appear as folders in the tree.\n\n#### Step 4: Create Subgroups (Hierarchical Nesting)\nSubgroups are nested under main groups for finer organization (e.g., under \u0022Participant Interviews,\u0022 subgroups like \u0022Male Participants\u0022 \u003E \u0022Age 20-30\u0022).\n1. Right-click on an existing main group.\n2. Select **New Document Group** (this creates a subgroup nested under it).\n3. Name the subgroup (e.g., \u0022Urban Residents\u0022).\n4. Drag-and-drop to nest further: To create a sub-subgroup, right-click a subgroup and select **New Document Group**, or drag an existing group onto another to make it a child.\n   - You can also use **Cut** (Ctrl\u002BX) and **Paste Special \u003E As Subgroup** (right-click target group) to reorganize.\n\n#### Step 5: Assign Documents to Groups and Subgroups\nDocuments can belong to multiple groups (via links) without duplicating files.\n1. Select one or more documents in the list (hold Ctrl for multiple).\n2. Right-click and choose **Add to Group** (or use the toolbar: the arrow icon pointing to a folder).\n3. In the dialog, select the target group or subgroup. Check \u0022Create link only\u0022 if you want non-destructive assignment (recommended to avoid duplicates).\n4. To move a document entirely: Drag-and-drop it onto the group/subgroup folder. It will nest under it.\n   - Tip: Use colors for visual organization\u2014right-click a group \u003E **Properties \u003E Color** to assign a color, which highlights assigned documents.\n\n#### Step 6: Advanced Organization Tips\n- **Working with Large Projects**: Use the search bar in the Document System to filter documents by name or content. You can also create \u0022Smart Groups\u0022 (in MAXQDA Analytics Pro or higher): Right-click \u003E **New Smart Group** to auto-populate based on criteria like keywords or codes.\n- **Memos and Links**: Attach memos to groups (right-click group \u003E **New Memo**) for notes on the category. Link documents across groups without moving them.\n- **Export/Backup**: To save your structure, export the Document System (Documents \u003E Export \u003E Document Groups) as a .mqd file or CSV for reports.\n- **Permissions and Teams**: If collaborating, use MAXQDA\u0027s team features (Project \u003E Teamwork) to share group structures.\n- **Common Pitfalls**: \n  - Groups don\u0027t import automatically\u2014always assign post-import.\n  - If documents are in subfolders during import, MAXQDA can mirror the file system hierarchy (check the import options).\n\n#### Example Structure\n- **Main Group: Interviews**\n  - Subgroup: Region A\n    - Sub-subgroup: Farmers\n    - Sub-subgroup: Urban Workers\n  - Subgroup: Region B\n    - Sub-subgroup: Students\n- **Main Group: Secondary Sources**\n  - Subgroup: Articles\n  - Subgroup: Reports\n\nThis setup keeps your analysis organized as your project grows. For coding or retrieval next, you can now assign codes directly to grouped documents. If you need help with subgroups for codes, linking data, or troubleshooting (e.g., version-specific issues), provide more details! For official resources, check MAXQDA\u0027s help menu (Help \u003E Online Manual) or their tutorials at VERBI\u0027s website.", "Mistral": "Certainly! MAXQDA is a powerful tool for qualitative data analysis, and organizing your documents effectively is crucial for a smooth analysis process. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set up your document system by organizing it into groups and subgroups:\n\n### Step 1: Import Your Documents\n1. **Open MAXQDA**: Launch the MAXQDA application.\n2. **Create a New Project**: Go to \u0060File\u0060 \u003E \u0060New Project\u0060 and give your project a name.\n3. **Import Documents**:\n   - Go to \u0060Documents\u0060 \u003E \u0060Import Documents\u0060.\n   - Select the documents you want to import. MAXQDA supports various file formats like text, PDF, Word, Excel, and more.\n\n### Step 2: Create Document Groups\n1. **Open the Document System**: In the main window, click on the \u0060Document System\u0060 tab.\n2. **Create a New Group**:\n   - Right-click in the \u0060Document System\u0060 area.\n   - Select \u0060New Document Group\u0060.\n   - Name your group (e.g., \u0022Interviews\u0022).\n\n### Step 3: Create Subgroups\n1. **Select the Parent Group**: Click on the group you just created (e.g., \u0022Interviews\u0022).\n2. **Create a Subgroup**:\n   - Right-click on the selected group.\n   - Select \u0060New Document Group\u0060.\n   - Name your subgroup (e.g., \u0022Phase 1 Interviews\u0022).\n\n### Step 4: Organize Documents into Groups and Subgroups\n1. **Move Documents**:\n   - Drag and drop the imported documents into the appropriate groups or subgroups.\n   - Alternatively, you can right-click on a document, select \u0060Move Document\u0060, and choose the desired group or subgroup.\n\n### Step 5: Verify and Adjust\n1. **Review the Structure**: Ensure that all documents are correctly placed in their respective groups and subgroups.\n2. **Adjust as Needed**: You can always move documents between groups or create new groups/subgroups as your analysis progresses.\n\n### Tips for Effective Organization\n- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your groups and subgroups to make navigation easier.\n- **Hierarchical Structure**: Think about the hierarchical structure that best fits your data. For example, you might have a top-level group for \u0022Interviews\u0022 with subgroups for different phases or themes.\n- **Document Metadata**: Use the document properties to add metadata (e.g., date, location, participant details) which can help in filtering and sorting later.\n\n### Example Structure\n- **Interviews**\n  - Phase 1 Interviews\n    - Interview 1\n    - Interview 2\n  - Phase 2 Interviews\n    - Interview 3\n    - Interview 4\n- **Surveys**\n  - Pre-Survey\n    - Survey 1\n    - Survey 2\n  - Post-Survey\n    - Survey 3\n    - Survey 4\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a well-organized document system in MAXQDA, making your qualitative analysis more efficient and manageable.
