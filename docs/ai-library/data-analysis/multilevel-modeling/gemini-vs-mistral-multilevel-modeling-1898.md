Calculate Intraclass Correlations (ICCs)\n\nThe ICC tells us the proportion of variance in the outcome that is accounted for by the grouping structure. For a 3-level model, we can calculate ICCs for both the school and district levels.\n\nWe calculate ICCs from the variance components of the *null model* (unconditional means model), which is our next step.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build Null Model and Assess Variance Components\n\nThe null model includes no predictors, only the random effects structure. This allows us to see how much variance in \u0060test_score\u0060 exists at each level (student, school, district).\n\nThe formula \u0060(1 | district_id / school_id)\u0060 in \u0060lme4\u0060 is a shorthand for nested random intercepts:\n*   \u00601 | district_id\u0060: Random intercept for each district.\n*   \u00601 | school_id:district_id\u0060 (implicitly handled by \u0060/\u0060): Random intercept for each school *within* its district.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# 2.1 Build the null model\nnull_model \u003C- lmer(test_score ~ (1 | district_id / school_id), data = df_full)\n\n# 2.2 Assess variance components\nsummary(null_model)\nVarCorr(null_model)\n\n# 2.3 Calculate ICCs using the \u0027performance\u0027 package\nicc_null \u003C- icc(null_model)\nprint(icc_null)\n\n# Manual ICC calculation from VarCorr (for understanding)\nvc_null \u003C- VarCorr(null_model)\nvar_district \u003C- as.data.frame(vc_null)$vcov[1] # Variance for district_id\nvar_school_within_district \u003C- as.data.frame(vc_null)$vcov[2] # Variance for school_id:district_id\nvar_residual \u003C- as.data.frame(vc_null)$vcov[3] # Residual variance (student level)\n\ntotal_variance \u003C- var_district \u002B var_school_within_district \u002B var_residual\n\nicc_district \u003C- var_district / total_variance\nicc_school_within_district \u003C- var_school_within_district / total_variance\n\ncat(\u0022\\nManual ICC Calculations:\\n\u0022)\ncat(\u0022ICC (District Level):\u0022, round(icc_district, 3), \u0022\\n\u0022)\ncat(\u0022ICC (School Level within District):\u0022, round(icc_school_within_district, 3), \u0022\\n\u0022)\ncat(\u0022Proportion of variance at Student Level:\u0022, round(var_residual / total_variance, 3), \u0022\\n\u0022)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation of ICCs:**\n\n*   **ICC (District Level):** This tells you the proportion of total variance in test scores that lies *between* districts. For example, if it\u0027s 0.10, 10% of the variance in test scores is due to differences between districts.\n*   **ICC (School Level within District):** This tells you the proportion of total variance in test scores that lies *between* schools *within* districts. For example, if it\u0027s 0.15, 15% of the variance is due to differences between schools (after accounting for district differences).\n*   The remaining variance (1 - ICC_district - ICC_school) is at the student level.\n*   These values often indicate that a multi-level model is appropriate, as a significant portion of the variance is at higher levels.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Add Level-1 Predictors (Student SES, Prior Achievement)\n\nNow, let\u0027s add \u0060student_ses\u0060 and \u0060prior_achievement\u0060 to our model. We\u0027ll start with them having fixed effects across all schools and districts, while still allowing for random intercepts at the school and district levels.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# Grand mean center student_ses and prior_achievement for interpretation\n# (Already done in simulation using scale(), but re-do for safety if not simulated this way)\ndf_full$student_ses_c \u003C- scale(df_full$student_ses, scale = FALSE)\ndf_full$prior_achievement_c \u003C- scale(df_full$prior_achievement, scale = FALSE)\n\nmodel_L1 \u003C- lmer(test_score ~ student_ses_c \u002B prior_achievement_c \u002B \n                  (1 | district_id / school_id), \n                  data = df_full)\n\nsummary(model_L1)\nVarCorr(model_L1)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Fixed Effects:** Look at the \u0060Estimate\u0060 column for \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 and \u0060prior_achievement_c\u0060. These tell you the average effect of a one-unit increase in each predictor on \u0060test_score\u0060, holding other variables constant. The \u0060t value\u0060 and approximate \u0060p-value\u0060 (from \u0060summary()\u0060) indicate statistical significance.\n*   **Variance Components:** Observe how the \u0060Residual\u0060 variance component changes compared to the null model. It should typically decrease, indicating that some of the student-level variance is explained by these L1 predictors. The school and district random intercept variances might also change slightly, but often less dramatically at this stage.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add Level-2 Predictors (School Resources)\n\nNext, we introduce \u0060school_resources\u0060, which is a Level-2 predictor. This variable will help explain the variance *between* schools.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# School_resources is already centered from simulation\nmodel_L2 \u003C- lmer(test_score ~ student_ses_c \u002B prior_achievement_c \u002B school_resources \u002B \n                  (1 | district_id / school_id), \n                  data = df_full)\n\nsummary(model_L2)\nVarCorr(model_L2)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Fixed Effects:** The \u0060Estimate\u0060 for \u0060school_resources\u0060 tells you the average effect of a one-unit increase in school resources on \u0060test_score\u0060.\n*   **Variance Components:** Pay close attention to the \u0060school_id:district_id\u0060 variance component (variance of school-level intercepts). It should decrease compared to \u0060model_L1\u0060, indicating that \u0060school_resources\u0060 explains some of the between-school variation in \u0060test_score\u0060.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Test Cross-Level Interactions\n\nA cross-level interaction examines whether the effect of a Level-1 predictor (e.g., \u0060student_ses\u0060) varies depending on a Level-2 predictor (e.g., \u0060school_resources\u0060). To model this, we need to allow the slope of the Level-1 predictor to vary randomly across Level-2 units (schools in this case).\n\nThe syntax \u0060(student_ses_c | school_id)\u0060 means:\n*   Allow the *intercept* to vary randomly across \u0060school_id\u0060.\n*   Allow the *slope of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060* to vary randomly across \u0060school_id\u0060.\n\nAnd \u0060(1 | district_id)\u0060 still allows for random intercepts at the district level.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# Model with random slopes for student_ses at the school level, and cross-level interaction\nmodel_interaction \u003C- lmer(test_score ~ student_ses_c \u002B prior_achievement_c \u002B school_resources \u002B \n                           student_ses_c:school_resources \u002B # Cross-level interaction term\n                           (student_ses_c | school_id) \u002B    # Random intercept and random slope of SES for schools\n                           (1 | district_id),                # Random intercept for districts\n                           data = df_full,\n                           control = lmerControl(optimizer = \u0022bobyqa\u0022)) # Use a more robust optimizer\n\nsummary(model_interaction)\nVarCorr(model_interaction)\n\n# You can compare this model to the previous one using anova (for nested models)\n# Note: For random effects, LRT might be anti-conservative. Better to use AIC/BIC for comparison.\nanova(model_L2, model_interaction) \n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Fixed Effects (\u0060student_ses_c:school_resources\u0060):**\n    *   If this term is significant, it means the effect of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 on \u0060test_score\u0060 changes depending on the level of \u0060school_resources\u0060.\n    *   For example, a positive interaction means that the positive effect of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 on \u0060test_score\u0060 is *stronger* in schools with more \u0060school_resources\u0060. Or, the negative effect of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 is *less negative* (attenuated) in schools with more resources.\n    *   The interpretation of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 now becomes \u0022the effect of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 when \u0060school_resources\u0060 is at its average (0, due to centering).\u0022\n*   **Random Effects (\u0060VarCorr()\u0060):**\n    *   You\u0027ll see a variance component for \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 within \u0060school_id\u0060. A significant variance here suggests that the relationship between \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 and \u0060test_score\u0060 indeed varies across schools.\n    *   You\u0027ll also see a covariance term between the random intercept and random slope for schools.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Report Random Effects and Fixed Effects\n\nTo report the results clearly, especially for publication or presentations, \u0060sjPlot::tab_model()\u0060 is incredibly useful. We can also manually extract these.\n\n### Fixed Effects\n\nThese are the average effects of the predictors across all schools and districts.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# Using sjPlot for a nice table\ntab_model(model_interaction,\n          show.ci = TRUE, show.se = TRUE, show.p = TRUE,\n          dv.labels = \u0022Test Score\u0022,\n          pred.labels = c(\u0022Intercept\u0022, \u0022Student SES (centered)\u0022, \u0022Prior Achievement (centered)\u0022, \n                          \u0022School Resources (centered)\u0022, \u0022Student SES x School Resources\u0022))\n\n# Manual extraction\nfixed_effects \u003C- fixef(model_interaction)\nse_fixed_effects \u003C- sqrt(diag(vcov(model_interaction))) # Standard errors\np_values \u003C- coef(summary(model_interaction))[, \u0022Pr(\u003E|t|)\u0022] # Approximate p-values\n\nfixed_effects_df \u003C- data.frame(\n  Estimate = fixed_effects,\n  SE = se_fixed_effects,\n  P_Value = p_values\n)\nprint(fixed_effects_df)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation of Fixed Effects:**\n\n*   **Intercept:** The predicted \u0060test_score\u0060 for a student with average \u0060student_ses_c\u0060, average \u0060prior_achievement_c\u0060, in a school with average \u0060school_resources\u0060, and at the average district/school.\n*   **\u0060student_ses_c\u0060:** For every one-unit increase in student SES (at average school resources), the \u0060test_score\u0060 is predicted to change by this amount.\n*   **\u0060prior_achievement_c\u0060:** For every one-unit increase in prior achievement, the \u0060test_score\u0060 is predicted to change by this amount.\n*   **\u0060school_resources\u0060:** For every one-unit increase in school resources, the \u0060test_score\u0060 is predicted to change by this amount (for students with average SES).\n*   **\u0060student_ses_c:school_resources\u0060:** This is the interaction term. It represents how the slope of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 changes for every one-unit increase in \u0060school_resources\u0060.\n\n### Random Effects\n\nThese describe the variability *around* the fixed effects at each level of the hierarchy.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# Using sjPlot for a nice table\ntab_model(model_interaction, type = \u0022re\u0022, \n          dv.labels = \u0022Test Score\u0022)\n\n# Manual extraction\nrandom_effects \u003C- as.data.frame(VarCorr(model_interaction))\nprint(random_effects)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Interpretation of Random Effects:**\n\n*   **\u0060district_id\u0060 (Intercept variance):** This is the variance of the district-level intercepts.

A significant variance here suggests that the effect of \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 on \u0060test_score\u0060 is not constant across schools but varies.\n*   **\u0060Corr\u0060 (\u0060(Intercept), student_ses_c\u0060):** This is the correlation between the random intercept and random slope for \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 at the school level. A positive correlation means that schools with higher average \u0060test_scores\u0060 (higher intercepts) also tend to have a stronger positive relationship between \u0060student_ses_c\u0060 and \u0060test_score\u0060.\n*   **\u0060Residual\u0060:** This is the variance of the student-level errors (the unexplained variance at the lowest level).\n\n---\n\n### Visualization of Random Effects (Optional but Recommended)\n\nYou can visualize how individual school intercepts and slopes deviate from the overall fixed effects.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060R\n# Extract random effects for schools\nranef_schools \u003C- ranef(model_interaction)$school_id\n\n# Plot random intercepts for schools\nggplot(ranef_schools, aes(x = \u0060(Intercept)\u0060)) \u002B\n  geom_density(fill = \u0022lightblue\u0022, alpha = 0.7) \u002B\n  labs(title = \u0022Distribution of School Random Intercepts\u0022,\n       x = \u0022Deviation from Average Test Score\u0022) \u002B\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Plot random slopes for student_ses_c across schools\nggplot(ranef_schools, aes(x = student_ses_c)) \u002B\n  geom_density(fill = \u0022lightgreen\u0022, alpha = 0.7) \u002B\n  labs(title = \u0022Distribution of School Random Slopes for Student SES\u0022,\n       x = \u0022Deviation from Average SES Slope\u0022) \u002B\n  theme_minimal()\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive guide should help you navigate your 3-level multi-level model in R.
