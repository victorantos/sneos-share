  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Self-seeding plants are those that readily drop seeds which then germinate and grow the following season, often resulting in new plants without additional planting effort. Here is a list of common self-seeding plants, including flowers, herbs, and vegetables:\n\n### Self-Seeding Flowers:\n1. **Calendula (Pot Marigold)**\n2. **Cosmos**\n3. **Nigella (Love-in-a-Mist)**\n4. **Larkspur**\n5. **Sweet Peas**\n6. **Poppies**\n7. **Cornflowers (Bachelor\u2019s Button)**\n8. **Snapdragons**\n9. **Dill**\n10. **Love Lies Bleeding (Amaranth)**\n11. **Forget-Me-Not**\n12. **California Poppy**\n13. **Sunflowers**\n14. **Foxglove**\n15. **Wallflower**\n\n### Self-Seeding Herbs:\n1. **Basil** (some varieties)\n2. **Cilantro (Coriander)**\n3. **Chives**\n4. **Dill**\n5. **Parsley**\n6. **Thyme** (can self-seed in ideal conditions)\n7. **Fennel**\n\n### Self-Seeding Vegetables:\n1. **Lettuce**\n2. **Radish**\n3. **Peas**\n4. **Spinach**\n5. **Swiss Chard**\n\n### Tips for Managing Self-Seeding Plants:\n- Allow some seed heads to dry on the plant before collecting seeds or letting them drop naturally.\n- Thin seedlings in the next season to avoid overcrowding.\n- Some plants might spread aggressively, so monitor their growth.\n\nIf you have specific plants in mind or want recommendations for certain garden conditions, let me know!", "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a list of self-seeding plants, categorized for easier browsing. Keep in mind that \u0022self-seeding\u0022 can be a spectrum. Some are prolific, others are more moderate. Also, invasiveness varies by region! **Always check with your local extension office or native plant society to ensure a plant isn\u0027t considered invasive in your area before planting it.**\n\n**Key Considerations for Self-Seeding Plants:**\n\n* **Climate:** What thrives in one zone might not in another.\n* **Soil Type:** Some plants prefer specific soil conditions.\n* **Sunlight:** Full sun, partial shade, or full shade?\n* **Aggressiveness:** How much do you want them to spread?\n* **Native vs. Non-Native:** Prioritize native plants whenever possible to support local ecosystems.\n* **Maintenance:** Will you need to thin them out?\n\n**Annuals (Complete their life cycle in one year):**\n\n* **Flowers:**\n * **Calendula (Calendula officinalis):** Easy to grow, medicinal properties.\n * **California Poppy (Eschscholzia californica):** Beautiful orange flowers.\n * **Cleome (Cleome hassleriana):** Tall, spidery flowers, attracts pollinators.\n * **Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus, Cosmos sulphureus):** Easy to grow, various colors.\n * **Johnny Jump Ups (Viola cornuta):** Cheerful, small flowers.\n * **Larkspur (Consolida ajacis):** Tall spikes of flowers, various colors.\n * **Love-in-a-Mist (Nigella damascena):** Delicate flowers and interesting seed pods.\n * **Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus):** Edible flowers and leaves.\n * **Poppies (Papaver rhoeas, Papaver somniferum):** Various types, beautiful flowers.\n * **Snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus):** While technically short lived perennials, often grown as annuals. Self-seed readily.\n * **Spider Flower (Cleome hassleriana):** Tall, distinctive flowers that attract pollinators.\n * **Stock (Matthiola incana):** Fragrant, beautiful blooms. Often considered biennial, but can self-seed annually.\n * **Sunflower (Helianthus annuus):** Tall, cheerful, attracts birds.\n * **Sweet Alyssum (Lobularia maritima):** Fragrant, low-growing.\n * **Zinnia (Zinnia elegans):** Easy to grow, bright colors, attracts butterflies (especially single-petal varieties).\n* **Herbs/Vegetables:**\n * **Arugula (Eruca vesicaria sativa):** Peppery leaves, great in salads.\n * **Borage (Borago officinalis):** Edible flowers and leaves, attracts bees.\n * **Cilantro/Coriander (Coriandrum sativum):** Leaves (cilantro) and seeds (coriander).\n * **Dill (Anethum graveolens):** Feathery leaves, used in cooking and for pickling.\n * **Lettuce (Lactuca sativa):** Various types, easy to grow.\n * **Radishes (Raphanus sativus):** Fast-growing root vegetable.\n\n**Biennials (Complete their life cycle in two years):**\n\n* **Flowers:**\n * **Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea):** Tall spikes of bell-shaped flowers (**poisonous, handle with care**).\n * **Hollyhock (Alcea rosea):** Tall, classic cottage garden flower.\n * **Honesty (Lunaria annua):** Attractive seed pods that resemble silver dollars.\n * **Sweet William (Dianthus barbatus):** Fragrant, clustered flowers.\n\n**Perennials (Live for more than two years):**\n\n* **Flowers:**\n * **Aquilegia/Columbine (Aquilegia spp.):** Delicate, spurred flowers, various colors.\n * **Blanket Flower (Gaillardia spp.):** Daisy-like flowers, drought-tolerant.\n * **Bleeding Heart (Dicentra spectabilis):** Heart-shaped flowers.\n * **Butterfly Weed (Asclepias tuberosa):** Attracts butterflies, especially monarchs. (Milkweed family - very important for Monarchs!)\n * **Coneflowers (Echinacea purpurea and others):** Daisy-like flowers, various colors, attracts pollinators.\n * **Daylily (Hemerocallis spp.):** Easy to grow, various colors.\n * ** \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0430 (Coreopsis spp.):** Daisy-like flowers, long blooming.\n * **Lupine (Lupinus spp.):** Tall spikes of flowers, various colors.\n * **Penstemon (Penstemon spp.):** Tubular flowers, attracts hummingbirds.\n * **Phlox (Phlox paniculata, Phlox divaricata):** Fragrant, clustered flowers.\n * **Sea Holly (Eryngium spp.):** Unique, thistle-like flowers.\n * **Sedum (Sedum spp.):** Succulent foliage, late-season flowers.\n * **Yarrow (Achillea millefolium):** Flat-topped clusters of flowers, drought-tolerant.\n* **Groundcovers:**\n * **Creeping Thyme (Thymus serpyllum):** Fragrant foliage, low-growing.\n * **Snow-on-the-Mountain (Aegopodium podagraria \u0027Variegatum\u0027):** Variegated foliage (can be aggressive).\n\n**Important Considerations and Caveats:**\n\n* **\u0022Self-seeding\u0022 Doesn\u0027t Guarantee True-to-Type:** Hybrids (especially in flowers like zinnias and impatiens) may not come true from seed. You might get variations in color or form.\n* **Control:** To manage self-seeding, deadhead flowers before they go to seed if you don\u0027t want them to spread. You can also pull up unwanted seedlings.\n* **Timing:** Some seeds need a period of cold stratification (exposure to cold temperatures) to germinate. This is often naturally provided by winter weather.\n* **Soil Disturbance:** Tilling or digging can bring dormant seeds to the surface, encouraging germination.\n* **Mulch:** Heavy mulching can inhibit self-seeding.\n* **Native Plants:** I cannot stress enough the importance of choosing native plants to support local wildlife and ecosystems.\n* **Regional Variations:** The success and invasiveness of plants can vary greatly depending on your specific location. Always check with local experts.\n\n**Before Planting:**\n\n1. **Research:** Look up each plant on your list to understand its specific needs and potential invasiveness in your region.\n2. **Observe:** Pay attention to your garden\u0027s existing conditions (sunlight, soil, moisture) to choose plants that will thrive.\n3. **Plan:** Consider the size and spread of each plant when mature.\n4. **Monitor:** Keep an eye on your self-seeding plants and manage their spread as needed.\n\nThis list provides a good starting point. Happy gardening! Let me know if you have more questions.\n", "Mistral": "Self-seeding plants are those that readily produce seeds and can naturally propagate themselves in your garden.
