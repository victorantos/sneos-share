  :responses='{"Claude": "# Aligning with NIH Data Sharing Mandates\n\n## 1) NIH Data Sharing Requirements Overview\n\n### **New 2023 Policy (Effective January 25, 2023)**\n\nThe NIH implemented a comprehensive Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy that significantly expanded previous requirements:\n\n#### **Who Must Comply:**\n- All NIH-funded research generating scientific data\n- Applies regardless of funding level (no cost threshold)\n- Includes all NIH grants, contracts, and other agreements\n\n#### **Key Requirements:**\n\n**A. Data Management \u0026 Sharing Plan (DMSP)**\n- Required at **application stage**\n- Must address:\n  - **Data type** (description of scientific data)\n  - **Related tools, software, and code**\n  - **Standards** (formats, metadata standards)\n  - **Data preservation, access, and timelines**\n  - **Access, distribution, and reuse considerations**\n  - **Oversight of data management**\n\n**B. Timing Requirements:**\n- Share data by time of **publication** OR\n- **No later than end of award period**\n- Whichever comes first\n\n**C. Where to Share:**\n- Must use established **repositories** (not personal/institutional websites)\n- NIH-supported repositories (when appropriate):\n  - **dbGaP** (genotype/phenotype data)\n  - **SRA** (sequence data)\n  - **ClinicalTrials.gov** (clinical trials)\n  - **NIMH Data Archive**\n- OR **generalist repositories**:\n  - **Dryad**\n  - **Figshare**\n  - **Zenodo**\n  - **Open Science Framework (OSF)**\n\n**D. Allowable Costs:**\n- Data management and sharing costs **are allowable** budget items\n- Can include:\n  - Repository fees\n  - Data curation\n  - De-identification\n  - Creating metadata/documentation\n\n---\n\n## 2) Practical Compliance Checklist\n\n### **Before Applying:**\n\n- [ ] **Identify what data** your project will generate\n- [ ] **Choose appropriate repository(ies)** early\n- [ ] **Budget for DMS costs** in your application\n- [ ] **Review relevant data standards** for your field\n- [ ] **Plan for informed consent** language (if human subjects)\n- [ ] **Check institutional policies** and support services\n\n### **In Your DMSP (2-page limit):**\n\n**\u2713 Data Type \u0026 Amount**\n- Describe scientific data (processed/analyzed, not raw unless valuable)\n- Estimate data volume\n- Describe formats\n\n**\u2713 Metadata \u0026 Standards**\n- Identify relevant standards (e.g., FAIR principles)\n- Describe documentation approach\n- Plan for data dictionary/codebook\n\n**\u2713 Access \u0026 Preservation**\n- Name specific repository\n- Specify timeline (e.g., \u0022upon publication\u0022)\n- Describe who can access (open vs. controlled)\n- Note embargo periods if needed\n\n**\u2713 Restrictions \u0026 Privacy**\n- Justify any access limitations\n- Address human subjects protections\n- Explain informed consent approach\n- De-identification procedures\n\n---\n\n## 3) Special Situations\n\n### **When You Don\u0027t Need to Share:**\n\nLegitimate reasons include:\n- **Legal restrictions** (e.g., tribal data sovereignty)\n- **Ethical concerns** (privacy cannot be adequately protected)\n- **Technical limitations** (too complex to reproduce)\n\n\u2757 **You still need a DMSP** explaining why data cannot be shared\n\n### **Genomic Data Special Rules:**\n- Follow **NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy**\n- Use **dbGaP** for large datasets\n- Obtain Institutional Certification\n- Implement appropriate consent\n\n### **Clinical Trials:**\n- Register at **ClinicalTrials.gov**\n- Share individual participant data (IPD) per ICMJE guidelines\n- Plan for clinical study reports\n\n---\n\n## 4) Quick Compliance Actions\n\n### **Immediate Steps:**\n\n1. **Review your active grants**\n   - Identify which are subject to 2023 policy\n   - Check your approved DMSPs\n\n2. **Set up repository accounts**\n   - Create ORCID if you don\u0027t have one\n   - Register with your chosen repositories\n\n3. **Create lab data management SOPs**\n   - File naming conventions\n   - Folder structures\n   - Versioning approach\n   -", "Grok": "### Understanding NIH Data Sharing Mandates\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has robust policies on data sharing to promote open science, transparency, and reproducibility. These are primarily outlined in the NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy, effective since January 25, 2023. It applies to all NIH-funded research generating scientific data, replacing the earlier 2016 Data Sharing Policy. Below, I\u0027ll break it down for you, focusing on key requirements. This is based on official NIH guidance (as of my last update in 2023; always verify the latest at [NIH Grants Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/nihgps/index.htm) or the [DMS Policy page](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy)).\n\n#### 1. **Scope and Applicability**\n   - **Who it affects**: Applies to all extramural research (grants, cooperative agreements) producing scientific data, regardless of funding amount (\u003E $0 threshold since 2023). It includes intramural and some contract research.\n   - **What counts as \u0022scientific data\u0022**: Digital recordings of observations (e.g., images, text, audio, or video) from instruments, sensors, or models, not including lab notebooks, preliminary analyses, or physical specimens. Metadata and documentation are included.\n   - **Exceptions**: Limited to cases like proprietary data, legal restrictions (e.g., HIPAA), or if sharing would cause harm. Even then, justification is required.\n\n#### 2. **Key Requirements**\n   - **Data Management Plan (DMP)**: \n     - Required for all new and competing renewal applications submitted on or after January 25, 2023.\n     - Submit a DMP (up to 2 pages) describing how data will be managed, preserved, and shared. It must address:\n       - Types of data to be generated.\n       - Standards for data formats and metadata (e.g., FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).\n       - Storage, backup, and security measures.\n       - Timeline for sharing (data should be made available no later than the end of the award or upon acceptance for publication; maximum 1 year post-publication in most cases).\n       - Mechanisms for access (e.g., public repositories like NIH\u0027s Generalist Repository or domain-specific ones like GenBank for genomics).\n     - Reviewed during peer review but not scored; non-compliance can affect future funding.\n   - **Data Sharing**:\n     - Data must be shared to allow validation of results or further research, unless restricted.\n     - Use established repositories (e.g., dbGaP for controlled access, Zenodo, or Figshare for open access). NIH provides a [list of repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/repositories).\n     - Include a Data Availability Statement in publications linking to shared data.\n     - Budget for sharing costs (e.g., repository fees) in grant applications; allowable up to the end of the project period.\n   - **Timeline**:\n     - Plan submission: With the grant application.\n     - Data sharing: As soon as possible, but no later than project end \u002B 1 year (or publication \u002B 1 year for unpublished data).\n     - Compliance reporting: Annual progress reports and final reports must confirm adherence.\n\n#### 3. **Aligning Your Practices**\n   - **Audit your current workflow**: Review your projects for data types and check if they generate \u0022scientific data.\u0022 Identify gaps in documentation, storage (e.g., use GitHub or OSF for versioning), and metadata.\n   - **Tools and Resources**:\n     - Use DMPTool (dmptool.org) for templates tailored to NIH.\n     - Adopt FAIR data principles; tools like DataDryad or Dryad help with deposition.\n     - For sensitive data, consider controlled-access options via dbGaP, including access agreements.\n   - **Training and Compliance**: NIH offers webinars (e.g., via NOT-OD-22-198). Track updates via the NIH Extramural Nexus blog.\n   - **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Can lead to withholding of funds, restrictions on future awards, or required remediation.\n\nIf your query was cut off (e.g., \u0022NIH\u0022 and more funders like NSF or EU Horizon), provide details for others. For personalized advice, consult your institution\u0027s grants office or NIH program officer, as requirements can vary by institute (e.g., NIAID has additional rules).
