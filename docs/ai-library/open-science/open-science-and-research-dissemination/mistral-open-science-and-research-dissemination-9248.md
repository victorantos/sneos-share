  :responses='{"Mistral": "Creating a living systematic review (LSR) involves setting up an infrastructure that allows for continuous updates and integration of new evidence. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set up the necessary infrastructure:\n\n### 1. Define the Scope and Objectives\n- **Research Question**: Clearly define the research question or objectives of your systematic review.\n- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: Establish criteria for including and excluding studies.\n- **Search Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant studies.\n\n### 2. Assemble a Team\n- **Core Team**: Include experts in systematic reviews, information specialists, and subject matter experts.\n- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define roles such as search coordinator, data extractor, and quality assessor.\n\n### 3. Set Up a Document Management System\n- **Reference Management Software**: Use tools like EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley to manage references.\n- **Data Extraction Tools**: Utilize software like Covidence, Rayyan, or DistillerSR for data extraction and management.\n- **Version Control**: Implement version control systems like GitHub for managing updates and changes.\n\n### 4. Develop a Search and Monitoring Strategy\n- **Automated Alerts**: Set up automated alerts in databases like PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to receive updates on new publications.\n- **Regular Searches**: Schedule regular manual searches to ensure no relevant studies are missed.\n- **Grey Literature**: Include sources of grey literature such as conference proceedings, dissertations, and preprint servers.\n\n### 5. Establish a Workflow for Continuous Updates\n- **Screening**: Develop a protocol for screening new studies for relevance.\n- **Data Extraction**: Create standardized forms for data extraction.\n- **Quality Assessment**: Use tools like the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality assessment.\n- **Data Synthesis**: Plan for regular updates to the data synthesis, including meta-analysis if applicable.\n\n### 6. Implement Automation Tools\n- **Automated Screening**: Use machine learning tools like ASReview or RobotReviewer for automated screening.\n- **Automated Data Extraction**: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) tools for automated data extraction.\n- **Automated Reporting**: Implement tools for automated reporting and updating of the systematic review.\n\n### 7. Ensure Transparency and Reproducibility\n- **Protocol Registration**: Register your protocol with PROSPERO or a similar registry.\n- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of all processes, including search strategies, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data extraction methods.\n- **Open Access**: Consider making your data and methods openly accessible to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### 8. Plan for Regular Updates and Publication\n- **Update Schedule**: Establish a regular update schedule (e.g., quarterly, annually).\n- **Publication Plan**: Plan for regular publication of updates in journals or repositories that support living systematic reviews.\n- **Communication**: Develop a communication plan to disseminate updates to stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the public.\n\n### 9. Monitor and Evaluate\n- **Performance Metrics**: Track performance metrics such as the number of new studies included, time taken for updates, and user feedback.\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and improve your processes based on feedback and performance metrics.\n\n### 10. Engage Stakeholders\n- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage stakeholders in the planning and execution phases to ensure the review meets their needs.\n- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop to gather input from stakeholders and incorporate it into the review process.\n\n### Tools and Resources\n- **Reference Management**: EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley\n- **Data Extraction and Management**: Covidence, Rayyan, DistillerSR\n- **Version Control**: GitHub\n- **Automated Alerts**: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library\n- **Automated Screening**: ASReview, RobotReviewer\n- **Protocol Registration**: PROSPERO\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a robust infrastructure for a living systematic review that ensures continuous updates and integration of new evidence."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
