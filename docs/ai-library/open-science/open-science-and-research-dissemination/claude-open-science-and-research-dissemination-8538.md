  :responses='{"Claude": "# Guide to Documenting All Analysis Decisions\n\nMaking your research workflow transparent through comprehensive documentation is excellent practice. Here\u0027s how to document all analysis decisions effectively:\n\n## 1. **Create a Decision Log/Analysis Journal**\n\n**What to include:**\n- Date of each decision\n- Who made the decision (if team research)\n- What the decision was\n- Why it was made\n- What alternatives were considered\n- Potential implications\n\n**Format example:**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nDate: 2024-01-15\nDecision: Used median instead of mean for income variable\nRationale: Data showed significant right skew with outliers\nAlternatives considered: Trimmed mean, log transformation\nImpact: More robust to outliers; may lose information about high earners\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## 2. **Document Pre-Analysis Decisions**\n\n- **Research questions** and how they evolved\n- **Hypotheses** (including those later abandoned)\n- **Sample size calculations** and power analyses\n- **Inclusion/exclusion criteria** for participants/data\n- **Variable selection** rationale\n- **Pre-registration** decisions (if applicable)\n\n## 3. **Data Preprocessing Documentation**\n\nTrack every data transformation:\n- Missing data handling (deletion, imputation method, rationale)\n- Outlier treatment (identification method, how handled)\n- Variable transformations (log, square root, standardization)\n- Recoding decisions (binning, category merging)\n- Data cleaning rules (what was removed and why)\n\n## 4. **Statistical Analysis Decisions**\n\nDocument:\n- **Test selection** (why ANOVA vs. regression, etc.)\n- **Assumption checking** (what you tested, results, how violations were handled)\n- **Significance levels** (\u03B1 chosen and justification)\n- **Multiple comparison corrections** (which method, why)\n- **Model building strategy** (stepwise, theory-driven, etc.)\n- **Software and package versions** used\n\n## 5. **Negative Results \u0026 Dead Ends**\n\nCrucially, document:\n- Analyses that didn\u0027t work out\n- Hypotheses not supported\n- Models that didn\u0027t fit well\n- Why certain approaches were abandoned\n\nThis prevents \u0022fishing\u0022 accusations and shows intellectual honesty.\n\n## 6. **Use Version Control**\n\n- **For code**: Git/GitHub with meaningful commit messages\n- **For documents**: Track changes in Word, or version numbering\n- **For data**: Document any changes to datasets with version numbers\n\n## 7. **Create an Analysis Script/Notebook**\n\nUse:\n- **R Markdown** or **Quarto**\n- **Jupyter Notebooks** (Python)\n- **Stata do-files** with extensive comments\n- **SPSS syntax files** (not point-and-click)\n\nBenefits: Code \u002B narrative \u002B output in one document\n\n## 8. **Standardized Documentation Template**\n\nCreate a template with sections:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n1. Research Question\n2. Data Source \u0026 Collection\n3. Variables (operational definitions)\n4. Sample Characteristics\n5. Data Cleaning Steps\n6. Descriptive Statistics\n7. Assumption Tests\n8. Primary Analyses\n9. Sensitivity Analyses\n10. Deviations from Plan\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## 9. **Real-Time Documentation**\n\n- Document **as you go**, not retrospectively\n- Use **comments in code** extensively\n- Keep a **research diary/lab notebook**\n- Note the **date** of each analysis session\n\n## 10. **Metadata and Codebooks**\n\nCreate comprehensive documentation:\n- Variable names and labels\n- Coding schemes\n- Measurement scales\n- Sources for each variable\n- Transformations applied\n\n## 11. **Decision Flowcharts**\n\nCreate visual documentation:\n- Participant flow diagrams\n- Analysis decision trees\n- \u0022If-then\u0022 logic for data handling\n\n## 12. **Transparency Checklist**\n\nBefore finalizing, confirm you\u0027ve documented:\n- [ ] All data exclusions\n- [ ] All variable manipulations\n- [ ] All measures collected (even if not analyzed)\n- [ ] All experimental conditions\n- [ ] Sample size determination\n- [ ] Stopping rule for data collection\n- [ ] All statistical tests conducted\n\n## **Tools to Help**\n\n- **OSF (Open Science Framework)**: For pre-registration and documentation\n- **Protocols.io**: For detailed method protocols\n- **Electronic lab notebooks**: LabArchives, Benchling\n- **Reference managers**: Zotero, Mendeley (for tracking literature)\n- **Project management**: Notion,"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
