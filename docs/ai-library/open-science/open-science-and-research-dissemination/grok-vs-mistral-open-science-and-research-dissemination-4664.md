  :responses='{"Grok": "### Checking University Requirements for Depositing Your Dissertation or Thesis for Open Access\n\nTo make your dissertation or thesis open access (OA), the first step is verifying your university\u0027s specific policies, as requirements vary widely by institution. These often cover mandatory vs. optional deposit, embargo options, copyright permissions, and formatting. I\u0027ll guide you on how to check this systematically. Note: I can\u0027t access your personal records or real-time data, so you\u0027ll need to perform the searches yourself. If you provide your university\u0027s name, I can suggest more tailored links or tips.\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Your University and Official Repository\n- **Start with your institution\u0027s website**: Search for \u0022[Your University Name] thesis deposit\u0022 or \u0022[Your University Name] open access repository\u0022 on Google or the university\u0027s site search.\n  - Most universities have an institutional repository (IR) like DSpace, EPrints, or a custom platform (e.g., Harvard\u0027s DASH, Oxford\u0027s ORA, or MIT\u0027s DSpace@MIT).\n  - Common departments: Library services, Graduate School, or Scholarly Communications office.\n- **Why this matters**: Universities often require (or strongly encourage) depositing a copy in their IR for OA, which makes it freely available online while preserving your rights.\n\n#### Step 2: Review the Deposit Guidelines\n- **Key sections to check**:\n  - **Mandatory requirements**: Is deposit required for degree completion? (E.g., many UK universities under REF guidelines mandate OA for theses post-2012.)\n  - **Embargo periods**: Can you delay public access (e.g., 1-5 years) for commercial publication? Check if extensions are possible.\n  - **Full vs. partial access**: Some allow redacting sensitive sections (e.g., for patents).\n  - **Licensing and rights**: You\u0027ll likely retain copyright but grant the university a non-exclusive license to distribute. Review Creative Commons options (e.g., CC BY for broad reuse).\n  - **Formatting and submission**: File types (PDF/A recommended), metadata requirements, and submission portals (e.g., via ProQuest for US theses, which integrates with many IRs).\n  - **Exceptions**: Policies for classified research or collaborative work.\n- **Examples of university-specific resources** (adapt to your school):\n  - **US universities** (e.g., via ProQuest/ETD system):\n    - University of California: Search \u0022UC eScholarship thesis deposit\u0022 \u2013 requires OA deposit with embargoes up to 6 years.\n    - Stanford: Check \u0022Stanford Digital Repository\u0022 guidelines \u2013 optional but encouraged.\n  - **UK universities**:\n    - University of London: Use \u0022Senate Papers\u0022 or EThOS \u2013 mandatory OA after 1-year embargo.\n    - Cambridge: Apollo repository \u2013 requires deposit, with options for restricted access.\n  - **Other regions**:\n    - Australia (e.g., University of Sydney): Via their library\u0027s \u0022Thesis Submission\u0022 page \u2013 OA encouraged via TROVE.\n    - Europe (e.g., via OpenAIRE): Check national guidelines if affiliated with an EU-funded program.\n\n#### Step 3: Use External Databases for Broader Context\n- **ProQuest Dissertations \u0026 Theses Global**: If your thesis is already submitted here (common in the US), log in to check OA status and university overlays.\n- **EThOS (UK)** or **Trove (Australia)**: Search for similar theses from your university to see deposit norms.\n- **Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)**: Search roarmap.eprints.org for your university\u0027s IR policies.\n- **Publisher policies**: If publishing your work, cross-check with your target journal/book (e.g., via Sherpa/Romeo database) to avoid conflicts with OA deposit.\n\n#### Step 4: Contact Support and Next Steps\n- **Reach out directly**:\n  - Email your university\u0027s library thesis support team (find contacts via \u0022[University] graduate thesis office\u0022).\n  - Schedule a consultation with your advisor or graduate coordinator \u2013 they often handle compliance.\n- **Timeline**: Start early; deposit is usually required at or before degree conferral.\n- **Common pitfalls**: Forgetting third-party copyright (e.g., images) or not selecting the right license, which can limit future reuse.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve checked your university\u0027s rules, you can deposit via their portal (often automated). If it\u0027s not required, consider self-archiving on platforms like Zenodo, ResearchGate, or arXiv for broader OA reach, but confirm it won\u0027t violate any agreements.\n\nIf you share your university or more details (e.g., country), I can refine this advice or point to exact pages!", "Mistral": "To make your dissertation or thesis open access and ensure you meet your university\u0027s requirements for deposit, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Check University Requirements for Deposit\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Review University Policies:**\n   - **Visit the University Library Website:** Most universities have detailed guidelines on their library or graduate school websites. Look for sections related to \u0022Thesis and Dissertation Submission,\u0022 \u0022Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs),\u0022 or \u0022Open Access Policies.\u0022\n   - **Consult the Graduate School Handbook:** This document often contains specific requirements and procedures for thesis and dissertation submission.\n\n2. **Identify the Repository:**\n   - **Institutional Repository:** Many universities have their own institutional repositories where you can deposit your work. Examples include DSpace, Digital Commons, and eScholarship.\n   - **External Repositories:** Some universities may allow or require submission to external repositories like ProQuest or arXiv.\n\n3. **Understand Formatting Requirements:**\n   - **File Format:** Ensure your document is in the required format (e.g., PDF, Word).\n   - **Margins, Fonts, and Spacing:** Follow specific formatting guidelines provided by your university.\n   - **Title Page and Abstract:** Make sure these elements are formatted correctly.\n\n4. **Check for Embargo Options:**\n   - **Embargo Period:** Some universities allow you to embargo your work for a certain period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year) before it becomes openly accessible.\n   - **Reason for Embargo:** You may need to provide a reason for the embargo, such as pending publication or patent applications.\n\n5. **Copyright and Licensing:**\n   - **Copyright Statement:** Ensure you include a proper copyright statement.\n   - **Creative Commons License:** Consider applying a Creative Commons license to specify how others can use your work.\n\n6. **Submission Process:**\n   - **Online Submission Portal:** Most universities use an online submission portal.
