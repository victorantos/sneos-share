New jobs will likely combine interdisciplinary skills and adapt to emerging challenges and opportunities.", "Grok": "Predicting specific jobs that will exist in 2035 but don\u0027t exist today involves some speculation, as technological, environmental, social, and economic trends will shape the future job market. However, based on current trajectories in technology, sustainability, healthcare, and societal needs, here are several potential jobs that could emerge by 2035:\n\n1. **Urban Farming Specialist** \n As cities grow and the need for sustainable food sources increases, vertical and urban farming will become more prevalent. Urban Farming Specialists will design, manage, and optimize high-tech indoor farms using hydroponics, aeroponics, and AI-driven crop monitoring to produce food in densely populated areas.\n\n2. **Climate Restoration Engineer** \n With the worsening effects of climate change, there may be a need for professionals who specialize in large-scale geoengineering projects to restore ecosystems, remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or mitigate rising sea levels. These engineers will work on innovative solutions like artificial reefs, carbon capture systems, or reforestation drones.\n\n3. **Human-Technology Integration Therapist** \n As humans increasingly merge with technology (e.g., brain-computer interfaces, wearable tech, or bioengineered enhancements), there will be a need for therapists who help individuals adapt psychologically and socially to these integrations. They might assist with \u0022cyborg identity crises\u0022 or the mental health impacts of constant connectivity.\n\n4. **Off-World Construction Worker** \n With space exploration advancing through companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, there could be a demand for workers who specialize in building infrastructure on the Moon, Mars, or space stations. These roles would involve expertise in 3D printing, robotics, and materials science for extraterrestrial environments.\n\n5. **Augmented Reality Journey Planner** \n As augmented reality (AR) becomes more integrated into daily life, there could be professionals who design immersive travel or entertainment experiences. These planners would create AR overlays for real-world locations, blending virtual storytelling, historical reenactments, or gamified exploration into physical spaces.\n\n6. **Personal Data Broker** \n With data becoming a critical personal asset, individuals might hire data brokers to manage, protect, and monetize their digital footprints. These professionals would negotiate with companies on behalf of individuals to ensure fair compensation for data usage while safeguarding privacy.\n\n7. **Extinct Species Revivalist** \n Advances in genetic engineering and de-extinction technologies (like CRISPR) could lead to roles focused on reviving extinct species, such as the woolly mammoth or passenger pigeon. Revivalists would work in labs and field settings to reintroduce these species into controlled or natural habitats.\n\n8. **AI Personality Designer** \n As artificial intelligence becomes more conversational and integrated into personal and professional lives, there will be a demand for designers who craft unique AI personalities for virtual assistants, companions, or customer service bots. These designers would focus on tone, humor, empathy, and cultural nuances.\n\n9. **Quantum Computing Security Analyst** \n With quantum computing on the horizon, traditional encryption methods could become obsolete. Quantum Computing Security Analysts will be responsible for developing and maintaining new security protocols to protect sensitive data in a post-quantum world.\n\n10. **Space Tourism Guide** \n As space tourism becomes more accessible, there will be a need for trained professionals to guide tourists through space experiences, ensuring safety, explaining scientific phenomena, and managing the psychological effects of space travel.\n\n11. **Re-Wilding Coordinator** \n As part of global efforts to restore natural ecosystems, Re-Wilding Coordinators will oversee projects that return cultivated or urban land to its wild state. They will work with ecologists, local governments, and communities to reintroduce native species and balance human and environmental needs.\n\n12. **Neural Privacy Advocate** \n With advancements in neurotechnology (e.g., brain-computer interfaces), there will be concerns about the privacy of thoughts and mental data. Neural Privacy Advocates will work to protect individuals from unauthorized access to their neural data and advocate for ethical regulations in this space.\n\n### Factors Driving These New Jobs\n- **Technological Advancements:** AI, quantum computing, biotech, and space tech are creating entirely new industries and challenges.\n- **Climate and Sustainability Needs:** The push for sustainability and climate mitigation will drive innovative roles in green technology and environmental restoration.\n- **Social and Ethical Shifts:** As technology integrates further into human life, new ethical dilemmas and psychological needs will emerge, requiring specialized professionals.\n\nWhile it\u0027s impossible to predict with certainty, these roles reflect plausible outcomes based on emerging trends. Many of these jobs will likely require cross-disciplinary skills, combining technology, ethics, and creativity. Preparing for such a future might involve learning adaptable skills in STEM, sustainability, and social sciences. What do you think about these possibilities? Are there other areas or trends you think might spawn new jobs by 2035?"}'
