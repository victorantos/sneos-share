This resume will be tailored to appeal to both human recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS).\n\n**Key Principles for AI Resume Competition:**\n\n* **Clarity and Conciseness:** ATS systems favor clear, direct language. Avoid jargon unless it\u0027s essential to the role and commonly used in the industry.\n* **Keywords:** Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description throughout your resume. (Don\u0027t stuff them in, use them naturally.)\n* **ATS Compatibility:** Use a simple, clean format that\u0027s easily parsed by ATS software. Avoid tables, images, unusual fonts, and excessive formatting. Stick to common fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Use a .DOCX or .PDF file.\n* **Quantifiable Results:** Show, don\u0027t just tell. Use numbers and metrics to demonstrate your impact in previous roles.\n* **Tailoring:** Customize the resume for each job application. Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the specific position.\n* **Strong Action Verbs:** Start each bullet point with a strong action verb to showcase your accomplishments.\n* **Showcase AI skills where applicable.**\n\n**Here\u0027s a template.
