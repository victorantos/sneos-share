Here\u2019s a guide to getting started with pickleball for seniors over 60:\n\n---\n\n### Why Pickleball is Great for Beginners Over 60\n1. **Low-Impact Exercise**: Pickleball is gentle on the joints compared to sports like tennis or running, making it ideal for older adults.\n2. **Social and Fun**: It\u2019s often played in doubles, fostering camaraderie and making it a great way to meet new people.\n3. **Improves Fitness**: It helps with balance, coordination, flexibility, and cardiovascular health.\n4. **Adaptable**: You can play at your own pace, whether casually or competitively.\n5. **Affordable and Accessible**: Equipment is inexpensive, and courts are often available at community centers, parks, or senior centers.\n\n---\n\n### Getting Started with Pickleball\n#### 1. Learn the Basic Rules\n- **Court**: A pickleball court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide (for doubles), about a third the size of a tennis court.\n- **Scoring**: Only the serving side can score points. Games are typically played to 11 points (win by 2).\n- **Serve**: The serve must be underhand, and the ball must bounce once on each side after the serve (the \u201Cdouble bounce rule\u201D).\n- **Non-Volley Zone**: Near the net is a 7-foot area called the \u201Ckitchen\u201D where you cannot hit the ball out of the air (volley) unless it bounces first.\n- **Basic Play**: Players hit the ball back and forth until one side misses, hits out of bounds, or violates a rule.\n\nThere are many beginner-friendly videos on YouTube, or you can read the official rules on the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) website.\n\n#### 2. Get the Right Equipment\n- **Paddle**: Lightweight paddles (6-8 oz) are best for beginners and seniors to avoid arm strain. Composite or graphite paddles are good options. Cost: $20\u2013$50 for a starter paddle.\n- **Ball**: Pickleballs are lightweight, plastic, and perforated. Use indoor balls for indoor courts and outdoor balls for outdoor play. Cost: $2\u2013$3 each or buy in sets.\n- **Shoes**: Wear supportive court shoes with good lateral stability to prevent slips or ankle injuries. Avoid running shoes, as they\u2019re designed for forward motion.\n- **Comfortable Clothing**: Wear breathable, moisture-wicking clothes.

Start with Basic Skills\n- **Grip and Stance**: Hold the paddle with a relaxed, handshake grip. Stand with knees slightly bent, ready to move.\n- **Serve**: Practice an underhand serve, aiming for the opposite diagonal court. Start with a gentle swing.\n- **Dinks**: Learn to hit soft, controlled shots near the net (in or just over the kitchen) to keep the ball low.\n- **Groundstrokes**: Hit the ball after it bounces, focusing on control rather than power.\n- **Positioning**: Stay near the baseline after serving, then move toward the net (if comfortable) for better control of the game.\n\nBegin by practicing with a friend or family member, hitting the ball back and forth slowly to build confidence.\n\n#### 5. Join Beginner Clinics or Lessons\n- Many communities offer free or low-cost pickleball clinics for seniors.
