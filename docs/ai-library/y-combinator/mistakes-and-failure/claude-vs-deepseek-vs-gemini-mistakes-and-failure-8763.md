  :responses='{"Claude": "You\u0027re referring to Paul Graham\u0027s advice about not chasing startup trends. This is a recurring theme in his essays and Y Combinator guidance. Here are the key points he typically makes:\n\n## Why Trend-Chasing is Problematic\n\n**Timing Issues**\n- By the time something is obviously trendy, you\u0027re likely too late\n- The best opportunities often look boring or unsexy initially\n- Markets get oversaturated quickly once trends become apparent\n\n**Wrong Motivation**\n- Building something because it\u0027s \u0022hot\u0022 rather than because you understand the problem deeply\n- Leads to shallow understanding of the actual market needs\n- Results in solutions looking for problems\n\n**Competition Density**\n- Everyone else is chasing the same trend\n- Harder to differentiate when you\u0027re in a crowded space\n- VCs get trend-fatigue and become more selective\n\n## What PG Recommends Instead\n\n**Focus on Problems You Understand**\n- Build things you personally need or have experienced\n- Deep domain knowledge beats trend-following\n- Authentic problems lead to better solutions\n\n**Look for \u0022Schlep\u0022 Opportunities**\n- Unsexy, difficult problems others avoid\n- Often have less competition but real market need\n- Can be more defensible once solved\n\n**Think Contrarian**\n- What\u0027s everyone ignoring that might be important?\n- Counter-positioning against popular trends\n- Finding value where others see none\n\nThe core insight: the best startups often don\u0027t look like startups to most people when they begin.", "DeepSeek": "Of course. This is a classic and crucial piece of advice for any aspiring founder. The warning against \u0022chasing startup trends\u0022 is not about ignoring the market; it\u0027s about understanding the difference between a genuine opportunity and a fleeting hype cycle.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of why PG (Paul Graham) and other seasoned investors warn against this, and what you should do instead.\n\n### Why Chasing Trends is Dangerous\n\n1. **You\u0027re Already Late:** By the time a trend is obvious enough for you to notice and decide to build something, the first-movers have already secured funding, top talent, and media attention. You\u0027re starting the race miles behind.\n2. **The \u0022Me-Too\u0022 Trap:** It\u0027s incredibly difficult to differentiate yourself in a crowded, trendy space. You end up in a feature war with well-funded competitors, rather than solving a unique problem. Your pitch becomes \u0022We\u0027re like [Trendy Company X], but better/faster/cheaper,\u0022 which is a weak position.\n3. **Superficial Understanding:** When you chase a trend, you\u0027re often solving a problem you don\u0027t deeply understand or care about. This leads to building a solution in search of a problem, rather than the other way around. Founders who live and breathe a problem (the \u0022scratch your own itch\u0022 model) have a massive advantage.\n4. **The Hype Cycle Cools:** Trends are, by nature, cyclical. The hype around AI, Web3, or the Metaverse eventually settles. If you built your company on the peak of inflated expectations, you\u0027ll be left with no real customers when the trough of disillusionment hits. Your investors will get spooked, and talent will leave.\n5. **It Attracts the Wrong Kind of Founder:** Trend-chasing often attracts people who are in it for the \u0022startup\u0022 glamour or a quick flip, not the long, hard work of building a lasting company. These founders are more likely to give up when things get tough.\n\n---\n\n### What PG and Y Combinator Actually Advise: \u0022It\u0027s Better to Be a Trend-Spotter Than a Trend-Chaser\u0022\n\nThe alternative isn\u0027t to ignore the market. It\u0027s to be smarter about how you find your idea.\n\n1. **Live in the Future and Build What\u0027s Missing (The PG Classic):**\n * This is the core of the advice. Become an expert in a domain *before* it becomes a mainstream trend. Work in an industry, have a unique hobby, or be part of a community that is underserved by current technology.\n * **Example:** The founders of Airbnb were *living* the problem of not being able to pay their rent. They weren\u0027t chasing a \u0022sharing economy\u0022 trend; they were solving their own immediate, painful problem. They *built what was missing* from their world.\n\n2. **Solve a \u0022Painful\u0022 Problem, Not a \u0022Cool\u0022 One:**\n * Look for problems that people are actively complaining about, trying to hack together solutions for, or are willing to pay money to solve *today*.\n * A \u0022trendy\u0022 problem might be \u0022How can we put our company on the blockchain?\u0022 A painful problem is \u0022I waste 10 hours a week manually moving data between these two software tools.\u0022\n\n3. **Talk to Users, Not the Tech Press:**\n * Instead of reading TechCrunch to find your idea, go talk to 100 potential users. Understand their workflows, their frustrations, and their unmet needs. The best ideas come from deep empathy with a specific group of people.\n\n4. **Leverage Your Own Expertise (Founder-Market Fit):**\n * What do you know that most people don\u0027t? What unique skills, experiences, or connections do you have? Building a company in a domain you understand deeply is a huge competitive advantage, even if it\u0027s not \u0022sexy.\u0022\n * **Example:** A founder who spent 10 years in the logistics industry building a supply chain optimization tool has a far better chance than a recent CS grad chasing the same trend.\n\n---\n\n### How to Responsibly Engage with Trends\n\nThis doesn\u0027t mean you should ignore major technological shifts. The key is to use the trend as a tool, not the foundation.\n\n* **Use the New Technology to Solve an Old Problem:** Don\u0027t build \u0022an AI company.\u0022 Instead, ask: \u0022How can we use AI to radically improve customer support for e-commerce stores?\u0022 The trend (AI) is the *how*, but the problem (inefficient customer support) is the *why*.\n* **Look for the Adjacent Possible:** Often, a big trend (like the iPhone) creates a whole new ecosystem of adjacent problems and opportunities (mobile payments, better note-taking apps, new social networks). These are often better opportunities than the trend itself.\n\n### In a Nutshell:\n\n| If You **Chase a Trend**, You... | If You **Find a Problem**, You... |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Are in a crowded, red ocean. | Can create a new, blue ocean. |\n| Have to convince people they need your solution. | Find people already desperate for a solution. |\n| Compete on features and marketing spend. | Compete on deep understanding and fit. |\n| Are building for the tech press and investors. | Are building for your users. |\n| Are vulnerable when the hype dies. | Are resilient because you solve a fundamental need. |\n\n**Final Thought:** The most successful startups often look like bad ideas at the beginning. They are working on problems that seem small, niche, or uninteresting to the mainstream. By the time the trend-spotters notice them, they are already years ahead. Don\u0027t chase the wave; learn to see where the next one is forming.", "Gemini": "Paul Graham (pg), the co-founder of Y Combinator, has frequently cautioned against chasing startup trends. His reasoning, as inferred from his various essays and talks, boils down to a few key points:\n\n* **Trends are, by definition, already crowded:** By the time a trend is widely recognized, numerous startups are already pursuing it. This creates intense competition, making it much harder to stand out and succeed.\n* **Trends are often superficial:** They might be based on hype or fleeting interest rather than genuine, long-term value. Startups built on such trends are vulnerable when the hype dies down.\n* **Trends can distract from fundamental problems:** Founders might focus on fitting into a trendy narrative instead of identifying and solving real-world problems that people genuinely care about.\n* **True innovation often happens outside of trends:** The most groundbreaking startups often create new markets or redefine existing ones, rather than simply following what\u0027s popular. They tend to come from a first principle of solving a real problem.\n* **You\u0027re not learning valuable lessons:** By jumping on a trend, you might not be gaining expertise or unique insights that can differentiate you in the long run.\n* **Investors may be less critical:** During a trend, investors are often caught up in the excitement and may not conduct as thorough due diligence, leading to inflated valuations and unsustainable business models.\n\nInstead of chasing trends, pg advises founders to:\n\n* **Solve real problems:** Focus on identifying and solving problems that people actually have, even if those problems aren\u0027t currently trendy.\n* **Build something users love:** Create a product or service that users find genuinely valuable and enjoyable.\n* **Be original:** Strive to create something unique and differentiated, rather than simply copying what others are doing.\n* **Focus on long-term value:** Build a sustainable business model that can generate value over the long term, rather than relying on short-term hype.\n\nIn essence, pg\u0027s warning is a call for founders to be thoughtful and strategic, rather than simply chasing the latest shiny object. He believes that the most successful startups are those that are built on solid foundations, driven by a genuine passion for solving problems, and focused on creating long-term value."}'
