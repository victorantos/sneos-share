    "ChatGPT": "The minimum MVP (Minimum Viable Product) core value is to **deliver the smallest, most focused version of a product that provides value to users and allows for validated learning with minimal resources and effort**. \n\nIn other words, the key core values of an MVP include:\n\n1. **Build Fast and Lean** \u2013 Develop only essential features to test assumptions quickly.\n2. **User-Centric** \u2013 Ensure the product addresses a real user problem or need.\n3. **Validated Learning** \u2013 Use the MVP to gather feedback and data to inform future development.\n4. **Minimize Waste** \u2013 Avoid building unnecessary features until they are proven valuable.\n\nThese values help teams reduce risk, optimize resources, and iterate rapidly based on user feedback.",
    "Gemini": "The minimum MVP (Minimum Viable Product) core value is **validated learning**.\n\nHere\u0027s why:\n\n*   **Focus on Learning:** The primary goal of an MVP is not to build a perfect product right away, but to learn about your customers and validate your assumptions with the least amount of effort.\n*   **Validates Assumptions:** An MVP tests core assumptions about your product idea, target market, and business model.\n*   **Reduces Waste:** By focusing on learning, you avoid building features that no one wants or needs.\n*   **Customer-Centric:** Learning from real users ensures you build a product that solves their problems and meets their needs.\n\n**Other important values for an MVP, but secondary to validated learning:**\n\n*   **Solving a Key Problem:**  An MVP should address a core problem for a specific target audience.  However, identifying and validating *which* problem to solve is part of the learning process.\n*   **Usability:**  While the MVP should be usable, it doesn\u0027t need to be perfectly polished.  The focus is on functionality to test key hypotheses.\n*   **Viability (Business Sustainability):** Although viability is important, the immediate goal is to learn whether a viable business can *eventually* be built. The initial focus is on proving the value proposition.\n\nIn short, without validated learning, an MVP is just a small product, not a learning tool.\n",
    "Mistral": "Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) involves focusing on the core values that will make your product appealing and useful to early adopters. Here are some key core values to consider for an MVP:\n\n1. **Solves a Specific Problem**: Ensure your MVP addresses a clear and specific problem that your target audience faces. This is the primary value proposition.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: Keep the MVP simple and easy to use. Avoid adding unnecessary features that could complicate the user experience.\n\n3. **Speed to Market**: Prioritize getting the product to market quickly to gather feedback and iterate. This means focusing on essential features and avoiding perfectionism.\n\n4. **User Feedback**: Incorporate mechanisms for collecting user feedback. This is crucial for understanding what works and what needs improvement.\n\n5. **Scalability**: Ensure that the core architecture of your MVP can scale as you add more features and users. This doesn\u0027t mean building everything at once but planning for future growth.\n\n6. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Keep the development costs low by focusing on the most critical features. This allows you to test the market without a significant financial investment.\n\n7. **Validation**: The MVP should be designed to validate your business idea. This means it should provide enough value to attract users and gather data to inform future development.\n\n8. **Adaptability**: Be prepared to pivot based on user feedback and market response. The MVP should be flexible enough to accommodate changes.\n\n9. **Security**: Even in an MVP, basic security measures should be in place to protect user data and ensure trust.\n\n10. **Engagement**: Ensure the MVP has enough features to keep users engaged and interested. This could include basic gamification elements or a compelling user interface.\n\nBy focusing on these core values, you can create an MVP that effectively tests your product idea, gathers valuable feedback, and sets the stage for future development."
