    "ChatGPT": "\u0022Do things that don\u2019t scale\u0022 is a concept popularized by startup guru Paul Graham. It means that in the early stages of a startup, you should focus on manual, hands-on efforts to acquire customers and build your product, even if those methods aren\u2019t sustainable when your company grows large. The idea is to prioritize growth and deep customer understanding first, then automate or scale later.\n\nHere are some classic examples of \u0022do things that don\u2019t scale\u0022:\n\n1. **Manually Onboarding Users**  \n   - Personally guiding each new user through your product setup to ensure they get value.  \n   - Example: Airbnb founders personally meeting hosts to help take professional photos of their listings.\n\n2. **Hand-Editing Content or Listings**  \n   - Manually curating or creating content for your platform before automating content generation.  \n   - Example: Early Wikipedia editors manually organizing pages.\n\n3. **Direct Outreach and Relationship Building**  \n   - Sending personalized emails or making phone calls to potential customers or partners.  \n   - Example: Early Dropbox founders emailed people who shared their files to acquire beta users.\n\n4. **Providing Exceptional, White-Glove Customer Support**  \n   - Offering personalized, detailed support to your first customers to build loyalty and gather feedback.  \n   - Example: Zappos famously provided outstanding customer service that went well beyond typical industry standards.\n\n5. **Manual Quality Control**  \n   - Personally checking each product or service delivery to ensure quality.  \n   - Example: Etsy sellers personally packaging and writing thank-you notes to customers.\n\n6. **Customizing Product for Key Customers**  \n   - Making product modifications based on direct user requests to fit their needs exactly.  \n   - Example: Early startup founders customizing software features for their first few customers.\n\n7. **Hosting In-Person Events or Meetings**  \n   - Meeting with users or clients face-to-face to understand pain points and build trust.  \n   - Example: Founders of a B2B startup conducting in-person demos and workshops with initial clients.\n\nThese strategies are labor-intensive and not viable at scale but help startups deeply understand their users, create a great product, and establish initial growth. Once the startup grows, processes and automation can replace these manual efforts.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s brainstorm some classic \u0022do things that don\u0027t scale\u0022 examples, categorized for clarity.  This concept, popularized by Paul Graham of Y Combinator, is about prioritizing early customer acquisition and feedback through manual, often inefficient, processes that wouldn\u0027t be sustainable in the long run. It\u0027s about learning what works and building a foundation.\n\n**1.  Direct \u0026 Personalized Customer Onboarding/Support:**\n\n*   **Manually Onboarding Every User:** Instead of relying on automated tutorials or documentation, personally walk each new user through the product. This could involve a video call, screen sharing, or even in-person assistance (if feasible).  You learn their pain points and what they *actually* need.\n*   **Personalized Email Responses:**  Responding to every customer support email with a thoughtful, personalized answer, even if it takes significant time. Avoid canned responses as much as possible. Show genuine empathy and try to solve their unique problem.\n*   **Proactive Outreach:**  Instead of waiting for users to complain, proactively reach out to them (especially early adopters) to ask how they\u0027re doing, what they like, and what they\u0027re struggling with.\n*   **\u0022Concierge\u0022 MVP:**  Instead of building a fully automated product, manually fulfill the core service.  Imagine a food delivery app where *you* personally pick up the food and deliver it for the first few weeks. This validates the demand before you invest in the tech.\n\n**2.  Manual Customer Acquisition \u0026 Outreach:**\n\n*   **Going Door-to-Door (Figuratively or Literally):** For a local business, this could be physically visiting potential customers. For an online service, it could be individually reaching out to people who fit your target audience on social media, forums, or relevant online communities.\n*   **Hand-Picking Early Adopters:**  Instead of launching to the masses, carefully select a small group of ideal customers and give them exclusive access, early discounts, or personalized attention.\n*   **Attending Industry Events (even if they seem small):**  Actively networking and engaging in conversations, even if the immediate ROI isn\u0027t clear.  Focus on building relationships and understanding the market.\n*   **Writing Personalized Notes/Gifts:** Sending handwritten thank-you notes or small, thoughtful gifts to early customers or influencers. This creates a lasting impression.\n*   **Directly Sourcing Content:** Instead of relying on user-generated content, initially create the content yourself (blog posts, tutorials, demos) to set the tone and quality.\n\n**3.  Manual Product Development \u0026 Feedback:**\n\n*   **Building Features Based on Individual Customer Requests:**  Instead of prioritizing features based on a grand roadmap, prioritize the features that your most vocal early adopters are asking for.  This ensures you\u0027re building something people actually want.\n*   **Shadowing Users:** Observing users as they interact with your product (or a prototype) to understand their behavior and identify pain points.  Don\u0027t just ask them what they want; *watch* them.\n*   **\u0022Wizard of Oz\u0022 Testing:** Creating the illusion of a fully automated feature, but manually fulfilling the back-end tasks. For example, an AI-powered recommendation engine that is actually being curated by a person.\n*   **A/B Testing with Small Sample Sizes (Qualitative Focus):** While statistically insignificant for large-scale decisions, running A/B tests with small groups of users and focusing on the qualitative feedback can be valuable for early product iteration.  Understand *why* people prefer one option over another.\n*   **Prototype First, Code Later:** Before writing any code, create detailed prototypes (using tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or even paper) to test the user experience and gather feedback.\n\n**4. Operational Inefficiencies for Learning:**\n\n*   **Manually Processing Orders:** Even if you plan for an automated system, begin by manually processing orders. This helps you deeply understand the entire fulfillment process, from order entry to shipping.\n*   **Doing All the Sales Calls Yourself (as the Founder):** Even if you plan to hire a sales team, the founder should initially handle all the sales calls. This provides invaluable insights into customer needs, objections, and the sales process.\n*   **Tracking Everything Manually:** Using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track key metrics like customer acquisition cost, churn rate, and revenue. This forces you to understand the data and how it\u0027s generated.\n\n**Why Do These Things?**\n\n*   **Deep Customer Understanding:**  It forces you to truly understand your customers\u0027 needs, pain points, and motivations.\n*   **Rapid Iteration:**  You can quickly adapt your product based on direct feedback.\n*   **Building a Strong Foundation:**  You create a loyal base of early adopters who will champion your product.\n*   **Validation of Assumptions:**  You can test your assumptions about the market and your product before investing heavily in scaling.\n*   **Differentiation:**  In a crowded market, personalized attention can be a significant differentiator.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Know When to Scale:** The goal isn\u0027t to *always* do things that don\u0027t scale.  It\u0027s about using them strategically in the early stages.  Once you\u0027ve learned enough and validated your product, you need to start automating and scaling efficiently.\n*   **Document Everything:**  Carefully document the processes you\u0027re using, the feedback you\u0027re receiving, and the decisions you\u0027re making. This will help you when it\u0027s time to scale.\n*   **Focus on the Core Value:** Make sure the things you\u0027re doing that don\u0027t scale are directly related to delivering the core value proposition to your customers. Don\u0027t waste time on things that don\u0027t move the needle.\n\nIn short, \u0022doing things that don\u0027t scale\u0022 is a *strategy*, not a permanent state. It\u0027s about putting in the hard work upfront to build a solid foundation for future growth. Good luck!\n",
    "Grok": "\u0022Do things that don\u0027t scale\u0022 is a concept popularized by Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, in his essay on startup growth. It refers to the idea that early-stage startups should focus on manual, resource-intensive, or non-scalable activities to learn about their customers, validate their product, and achieve initial growth before worrying about efficiency or automation. The goal is to prioritize speed, customer feedback, and traction over building perfect, scalable systems from the start.\n\nHere are some examples of \u0022doing things that don\u0027t scale\u0022 in the context of startups or small businesses:\n\n### 1. **Manually Onboarding Customers**\n   - Instead of building an automated onboarding system, founders might personally reach out to early users, guide them through the product, and answer their questions one-on-one.\n   - Example: Airbnb founders manually helped early hosts take professional photos of their listings to improve the quality of the platform. This was time-consuming but helped build trust and attract more users.\n\n### 2. **Hand-Delivering Products or Services**\n   - Physically delivering products or providing services yourself to understand customer pain points and logistics.\n   - Example: The founders of DoorDash initially delivered food orders themselves to test the demand for a food delivery service and learn about restaurant partnerships and customer needs before building a scalable delivery network.\n\n### 3. **Cold Emailing or Direct Outreach**\n   - Personally sending cold emails, making phone calls, or meeting potential customers face-to-face to acquire early users.\n   - Example: Many B2B startups have founders cold-emailing or LinkedIn-messaging potential clients to secure their first few deals, even if it\u2019s not an efficient long-term strategy.\n\n### 4. **Manually Curating Content or Inventory**\n   - Instead of using algorithms or automated systems, manually selecting or creating content, products, or recommendations for users.\n   - Example: Early on, Pinterest founders manually curated pins and boards to ensure high-quality content for their initial users, which helped shape the platform\u0027s aesthetic and user experience.\n\n### 5. **Providing White-Glove Customer Support**\n   - Offering highly personalized customer support to early users, even if it takes a lot of time, to build loyalty and gather feedback.\n   - Example: Stripe founders personally handled customer support inquiries in the early days, directly engaging with developers to solve their payment integration issues and improve the product.\n\n### 6. **Recruiting Users One-by-One**\n   - Manually recruiting users or communities instead of relying on scalable marketing channels like ads.\n   - Example: Reddit\u2019s founders created fake accounts and posted content themselves to simulate activity and attract real users to the platform in its early days.\n\n### 7. **Customizing Solutions for Early Clients**\n   - Tailoring your product or service to meet the specific needs of your first few customers, even if it\u2019s not a scalable approach.\n   - Example: Many SaaS startups build custom features or integrations for their first enterprise clients to secure a deal, even if those features might not be relevant to a broader audience.\n\n### 8. **Hosting In-Person Events or Meetups**\n   - Organizing small, in-person events to build a community or gather direct feedback, even though it\u2019s not an efficient way to scale.\n   - Example: Early fitness apps or local service startups often host meetups or workshops to engage with their initial user base and build word-of-mouth.\n\n### 9. **Manually Processing Transactions or Operations**\n   - Handling backend operations by hand instead of automating them to save time and resources early on.\n   - Example: Groupon started by manually creating and emailing daily deals to subscribers before building an automated platform for merchants and customers.\n\n### 10. **Directly Asking for Feedback**\n   - Personally reaching out to users via email, phone, or in-person interviews to understand their needs and improve the product.\n   - Example: Dropbox\u2019s founder, Drew Houston, personally talked to early users and even watched them use the product to identify usability issues before scaling the team or marketing efforts.\n\n### Why Do Things That Don\u2019t Scale?\n- **Customer Insights**: Direct interaction helps you understand customer problems deeply.\n- **Validation**: Non-scalable methods can prove whether there\u2019s real demand for your product before investing in automation.\n- **Speed**: Manual processes can be faster to implement than building complex systems.\n- **Relationships**: Personal outreach builds strong relationships with early customers, turning them into advocates.\n\nWhile these tactics are not sustainable in the long run, they are critical for getting a startup off the ground. Once you\u2019ve achieved product-market fit and gained traction, you can invest in automation, scalability, and efficiency. The key takeaway is to prioritize learning and growth over perfection in the early stages."
