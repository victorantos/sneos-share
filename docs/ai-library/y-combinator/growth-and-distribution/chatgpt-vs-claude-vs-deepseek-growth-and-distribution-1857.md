    "ChatGPT": "Finding your first users is a crucial step for any startup. Here are some YC-style tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Build Something People Want**  \n   Before looking for users, ensure your product solves a real problem. Talk to potential users early and often to validate your idea.\n\n2. **Start with Your Network**  \n   Reach out to friends, family, former colleagues, and acquaintances who might be interested. Personal connections are often the easiest way to get early adopters.\n\n3. **Leverage Online Communities**  \n   Engage in relevant forums, subreddits, Facebook groups, or niche communities where your target users hang out. Participate genuinely before pitching your product.\n\n4. **Offer Incentives for Early Users**  \n   Consider early-bird discounts, exclusive access, or other perks to entice users to try your product.\n\n5. **Create Content and Share**  \n   Write blog posts, create videos, or podcasts addressing the problem your product solves. This can attract organic traffic and users interested in your solution.\n\n6. **Use Cold Outreach Thoughtfully**  \n   Identify potential users and send personalized emails or messages explaining how your product can help them. Avoid spammy approaches.\n\n7. **Build an MVP and Iterate Fast**  \n   Get your minimum viable product in front of users quickly to gather feedback and improve. Early users often become advocates if they feel involved.\n\n8. **Partner with Complementary Products**  \n   Find startups or businesses with similar audiences and explore co-marketing or referral partnerships.\n\n9. **Attend Events and Meetups**  \n   Networking in person can help you find enthusiasts and early adopters who are eager to try new products.\n\n10. **Measure and Learn**  \n    Track user engagement and feedback carefully. Use data to understand what works, then double down on effective channels.\n\nRemember, getting your first users takes patience and persistence. Focus on building relationships and delivering value, and your user base will grow organically.",
    "Claude": "Here\u0027s the classic YC wisdom on finding your first users:\n\n## Do Things That Don\u0027t Scale (Paul Graham\u0027s famous essay)\n- **Recruit manually** - Go get users one by one, don\u0027t wait for viral growth\n- **Make users incredibly happy** - Better to have 100 users who love you than 1000 who are lukewarm\n- **Be willing to do manual work** - Handle customer service, onboarding, even manual processes\n\n## Key Strategies from YC Companies:\n\n### 1. **Start with your network**\n- Friends, family, former colleagues\n- People who know you and will give honest feedback\n\n### 2. **Go where your users are**\n- Online communities (Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups)\n- Physical locations if relevant\n- Industry events and meetups\n\n### 3. **The \u0022Collison Installation\u0022** (from Stripe founders)\n- Don\u0027t just ask people to try your product\n- Sit with them and help them get set up\n- Watch them use it and fix problems in real-time\n\n### 4. **Launch on relevant platforms**\n- Product Hunt, Hacker News\n- Industry-specific forums\n- Social media where your audience hangs out\n\n### 5. **Cold outreach that works**\n- Be specific about why you\u0027re reaching out to them\n- Offer genuine value, not just a pitch\n- Keep it short and personal\n\n### 6. **Content and SEO**\n- Write about problems you\u0027re solving\n- Answer questions on Quora/Stack Overflow\n- Build an audience before you need customers\n\n## YC\u0027s Core Principle:\n**Talk to users obsessively.** The companies that succeed are maniacal about user feedback and iterate quickly based on what they learn.\n\nWhat type of product are you building? The strategy can vary significantly based on B2B vs B2C, marketplace, SaaS, etc.",
    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Finding your first users is one of the most critical and challenging phases for any startup. Y Combinator (YC) has a wealth of advice on this, which can be summarized as **\u0022Do things that don\u0027t scale.\u0022**\n\nHere is a synthesis of YC\u0027s core advice, broken down into a step-by-step guide.\n\n### The Core YC Principle: Do Things That Don\u0027t Scale\n\nBefore you automate, before you build a massive marketing funnel, you need to manually recruit and deeply understand your first users. This means:\n\n*   **Manually reaching out** to people individually (email, DMs, phone calls).\n*   **Going to where they are** (online communities, physical locations, conferences).\n*   **Onboarding them yourself** and watching them use your product.\n*   **Responding to their feedback instantly** and building features they request.\n\nThis hands-on approach seems inefficient, but it\u0027s the fastest way to find a product-market fit and turn early users into passionate advocates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Define EXACTLY Who Your First User Is\n\nYou can\u0027t find users if you don\u0027t know who you\u0027re looking for. Get specific.\n\n*   **Bad:** \u0022People who want to be more productive.\u0022\n*   **Good:** \u0022Marketing managers at tech startups with 10-50 employees who spend 5\u002B hours a week in meetings.\u0022\n*   **Even Better:** Create a list of 10-50 specific individuals or companies that perfectly fit this description. These are your initial targets.\n\n### Step 2: The \u0022Manual User Acquisition\u0022 Playbook\n\nThis is where you put \u0022doing things that don\u0027t scale\u0022 into action.\n\n#### 1. Leverage Your Personal Network (The Easiest Win)\n*   **Who to contact:** Friends, former colleagues, college classmates, LinkedIn connections.\n*   **What to say:** \u0022Hey [Name], I\u0027m building [Your Product] to solve [Specific Problem]. I know you\u0027ve faced this before. Would you be willing to be one of our first users and give me brutally honest feedback? It should only take 5 minutes.\u0022\n*   **Why it works:** They already know and (hopefully) trust you. They are more forgiving and more likely to give detailed feedback.\n\n#### 2. Go to Online Communities (The Digital Watering Hole)\n*   **Where to go:** Relevant subreddits, Slack/Discord groups, LinkedIn Groups, Twitter/X communities, niche forums (e.g., Indie Hackers, Product Hunt).\n*   **How to do it RIGHT:**\n    *   **Don\u0027t** just drop a link. That is spam.\n    *   **Do** become a genuine member first. Answer questions, provide value.\n    *   **Then,** when you have a reputation, you can post: \u0022Hey everyone, I\u0027ve been a member here for a while and I\u0027m building a tool to help with [problem the community often discusses]. I\u0027m looking for 3-5 people to try it for free and tell me if it\u0027s complete garbage or not. DM me if you\u0027re interested.\u0022\n*   **Pro Tip:** Search for people *complaining* about the exact problem you solve. That\u0027s your golden ticket. Message them directly: \u0022I saw your post about [problem] and I\u0027m building a solution. Can I give you free access to see if it helps?\u0022\n\n#### 3. The \u0022Collison Launch\u0022 (A YC Favorite)\nPioneered by the founders of Stripe (Patrick and John Collison). Instead of a slow, quiet build, launch everywhere at once.\n*   List your product on every relevant platform on the same day: **Product Hunt, Betalist, Hacker News, Reddit startups, etc.**\n*   The goal is to create a massive spike of traffic and sign-ups, giving you a large pool of early users to learn from very quickly.\n\n#### 4. Go Offline (If Applicable)\nIf your target user is in a specific physical location (e.g., local restaurants, coffee shops, gyms), **go there in person.** Nothing is more impactful than a face-to-face conversation. Show them the product on your laptop or phone.\n\n#### 5. Create Content (The Long Game)\n*   Start a blog, a Twitter/X account, or a YouTube channel focused on the problem you\u0027re solving.\n*   Answer common questions. Share your journey. This builds authority and attracts people who are already interested in your space.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What to Do When You Have Their Attention\n\nGetting a user to sign up is only half the battle. You need to convert them into a *happy* user.\n\n1.  **The High-Touch Onboarding:** For your first 10-20 users, offer to do a 15-minute video call to onboard them personally. Watch them use the product. See where they get confused. This is invaluable.\n2.  **The Feedback Loop:** After they\u0027ve used it, ask specific questions:\n    *   \u0022What was the moment you realized this was useful?\u0022\n    *   \u0022What was the most confusing part?\u0022\n    *   \u0022What\u0027s the biggest thing missing that would make you use this every day?\u0022\n3.  **Build a \u0022Core Group\u0022:** Create a dedicated Slack channel or email list for your first 10-50 users. Make them feel like insiders and co-creators. Implement their suggestions quickly and give them credit. They will become your evangelists.\n\n---\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n*   **Don\u0027t build a \u0022viral\u0022 or \u0022referral\u0022 mechanic yet.** Your product isn\u0027t ready for it, and it won\u0027t work without a solid core experience.\n*   **Don\u0027t spend money on ads.** It\u0027s a waste of cash at this stage. You won\u0027t know who to target or what message will convert.\n*   **Don\u0027t be afraid of a \u0022No.\u0022** You are searching for the \u0022Heck Yes!\u0022 Early on, a \u0022no\u0022 is just as valuable as a \u0022yes\u0022 because it helps you refine your target profile.\n\n### Key YC Quotes to Remember\n\n*   **\u0022It\u0027s better to have 100 users that love you than a million users that just sort of like you.\u0022** - Michael Seibel. Depth of love is your early indicator.\n*   **\u0022Write code and talk to users.\u0022** - Paul Graham. This is your only job as a founder at the start.\n*   **\u0022If you can\u0027t find a way for your users to pull your product out of your hands, then you need to rethink your product.\u0022** - Paul Buchheit. Your goal is to build something people *need*.\n\n### Summary: Your Action Plan\n\n1.  **List:** Write down 50 specific people/companies that are your ideal first users.\n2.  **Reach Out:** Manually email or DM them with a personal, low-pressure ask for feedback.\n3.  **Observe:** Get on a call and watch them use your product. Take notes.\n4.  **Iterate:** Fix the problems and build the features they request. Do this within days, not weeks.\n5.  **Repeat:** Go back to step 1 until your first 10 users are actively, happily using your product without you pushing them.\n\nThis process is hard, uncomfortable, and feels slow. But it is the single most reliable way to build a foundation for a successful, scalable company."
