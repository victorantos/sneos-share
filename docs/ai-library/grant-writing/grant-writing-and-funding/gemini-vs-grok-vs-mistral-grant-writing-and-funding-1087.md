Instructions can change.\n*   **Tailor, Tailor, Tailor:** Every section, especially A and C, should be specifically tailored to the grant you are applying for. Highlight experience and publications most relevant to the proposed research.\n*   **Proofread Meticulously:** Typos and grammatical errors undermine your professionalism. Have multiple people proofread it.\n*   **Ask for Feedback:** Share your biosketch with your mentor, PI, or colleagues for constructive criticism.\n*   **Maintain a Master Version:** Keep a comprehensive master biosketch that you can draw from for various applications, then customize as needed.\n*   **ORCID is Key:** Ensure your ORCID profile is up-to-date and comprehensive, as it\u0027s directly linked from your biosketch. MyBibliography is also highly recommended.\n*   **Be Specific:** Instead of \u0022I have strong experience in X,\u0022 say \u0022My research in X led to Y and Z.\u0022\n\nBy following these guidelines precisely, you will create an NIH Biosketch that is not only compliant but also effectively showcases your qualifications and scientific contributions. Good luck!", "Grok": "Below, I\u0027ll help you craft a biographical sketch (biosketch) for the NIH by explaining the precise format required by the National Institutes of Health (as of the current guidelines, effective January 25, 2020, via NOT-OD-20-050, with updates in NOT-OD-23-204 for biosketch-related instructions). NIH biosketches are used for grant applications (e.g., R01, K awards) and must follow a strict, non-negotiable structure to avoid rejection. You cannot exceed page limits, and formatting must adhere to SF 424 (R\u0026R) guidelines (e.g., Arial 11-point font, 0.5-inch margins, no hyperlinks).\n\nI\u0027ll outline the format step by step, provide a template with placeholders, and offer tips based on NIH\u0027s official instructions (found on the NIH website under \u0022Biosketch Format Pages\u0022). **Important:** This is a general template\u2014customize it with your real information. Do not fabricate data, as NIH verifies accuracy. If you\u0027re submitting, use the FORMS-H package in ASSIST or similar tools for validation.\n\n### Key NIH Biosketch Rules\n- **Length:** Up to 5 pages total (including sections A\u2013E).\n- **Order:** Follow sections A\u2013E exactly.

Be honest about overlap to avoid rejection.])\n\n---\n\n### Additional Guidance\n- **Filling It Out:** Tailor Section A to your specific grant (e.g., highlight expertise matching the RFA/PA). In Section C, quantify impact (e.g., \u0022This method has been adopted by 20 labs worldwide\u0022). Use DOIs/PMIDs for easy verification.\n- **Common Pitfalls:** Don\u0027t list all publications in C (only 4 per contribution); save full bibliographies for other sections if needed. If you\u0027re a new investigator, emphasize training/potential.\n- **For Specific Scenarios:** If this is for a training grant (e.g., F31), add scholastic performance in D. For non-PIs (e.g., consultants), shorten to 1\u20132 pages focusing on relevant expertise.\n- **Next Steps:** Review your draft against NIH\u0027s sample biosketches (search \u0022NIH biosketch examples\u0022 on grants.nih.gov). If you share more details about your background (e.g., field, key achievements), I can help refine specific sections without fabricating info.\n- **Validation:** Once complete, upload to NIH\u0027s ASSIST system to check formatting.\n\nIf this doesn\u0027t address your exact needs or you have a specific section to expand, provide more details!", "Mistral": "Certainly!
