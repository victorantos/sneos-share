  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Certainly! When requesting reviewers for an internal review of your grant proposal, it\u0027s important to identify individuals with relevant expertise who can provide constructive feedback. Here\u2019s a template you can use to send out your request:\n\n---\n\n### Subject: Request for Review of Grant Proposal\n\nDear [Reviewer\u0027s Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am in the process of preparing a grant proposal titled \u201C[Title of Your Grant Proposal]\u201D aimed at [brief description of the grant\u0027s purpose and objectives].

It would be ideal to have your feedback by [specific date].\n- **Format:** I can provide the proposal document in [Word/PDF/whatever format] for your review.\n- **Specific Areas of Feedback:** If you\u0027re willing to help, I\u2019d particularly appreciate your input on [mention any specific sections or components you wish them to focus on, such as methodology, budget, or the significance of the research].\n\nPlease let me know if you would be available for this review. I understand that your time is valuable, and I truly appreciate any assistance you can provide.\n\nThank you very much for considering my request!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Institution]  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n1. **Choose Reviewers Wisely:** Select reviewers who have expertise directly related to the grant\u2019s subject matter, methodology, or funding agency. Consider colleagues from different departments or institutions if relevant.\n\n2. **Be Clear and Concise:** Make sure your request is straightforward and easy to understand, respecting the reviewers\u0027 time.\n\n3. **Be Grateful:** Always express your gratitude for their time and effort, regardless of the outcome.\n\n4. **Follow Up:** If you don\u2019t hear back within a week or so, consider sending a polite follow-up email.\n\nFeel free to customize the template according to your needs!", "Gemini": "Getting internal review is a critical step for a successful grant application! It allows you to catch errors, strengthen your arguments, and ensure clarity before the final submission.\n\nHere\u0027s a comprehensive guide to help you request reviewers with relevant expertise, including identifying potential reviewers, preparing your materials, and crafting a compelling request.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Requesting Reviewers with Relevant Expertise\n\nThis involves three main steps: **A. Identifying Potential Reviewers, B. Preparing Your Materials, and C. Crafting the Request Email.**\n\n---\n\n### A. Identifying Potential Reviewers (Who to Ask)\n\nThink broadly but strategically about who can offer the most valuable feedback for different aspects of your grant. Aim for 2-4 reviewers, ideally with diverse perspectives.\n\n1.  **Direct Colleagues/Lab Members:**\n    *   **Pros:** Familiar with your work, methodology, and lab resources. Can provide granular feedback.\n    *   **Cons:** Might be too close to the project to see big-picture flaws or lack specific expertise for a niche aspect.\n    *   **Best for:** Detailed methods, feasibility, internal consistency, preliminary data interpretation.\n\n2.  **Faculty in Your Department/Center (But Not Direct Collaborators):**\n    *   **Pros:** Understands the institutional context, often has grant-writing experience in your field, can provide \u0022outsider but insider\u0022 perspective.\n    *   **Cons:** May not have *deep* expertise in your exact sub-area.\n    *   **Best for:** Overall scientific merit, significance, clarity of aims, approach, and how it fits into the broader field.\n\n3.  **Faculty/Researchers in *Related* Fields (Cross-Department/Institution):**\n    *   **Pros:** Can identify jargon, assess broader impact, and ensure your proposal is accessible to reviewers outside your immediate niche. Excellent for multidisciplinary grants.\n    *   **Cons:** Might miss highly technical details specific to your field.\n    *   **Best for:** Clarity, broader impact, readability for a general scientific audience, potential for new collaborations.\n\n4.  **Experienced Grant Writers/Awardees (Mentors, Senior Faculty):**\n    *   **Pros:** Have successfully navigated the grant landscape, understand funding agency priorities, and can provide strategic advice on framing and persuasiveness.\n    *   **Cons:** May be very busy; might focus more on \u0022grant strategy\u0022 than deep scientific dive.\n    *   **Best for:** Overall strategy, responsiveness to review criteria, budget justification, biosketch/other support review, common pitfalls.\n\n5.  **Former Reviewers for Your Target Funding Mechanism:**\n    *   **Pros:** Understand the unwritten rules, common reviewer biases, and specific expectations of the review panel.\n    *   **Cons:** Harder to identify unless they\u0027ve served on a panel you know.\n    *   **Best for:** Grant-specific advice, \u0022reviewer mindset.\u0022\n\n6.  **Junior Faculty/Postdocs (Especially if they\u0027ve written similar grants):**\n    *   **Pros:** Often very thorough, eager to help, and can provide fresh eyes on the science. They\u0027ve recently been through the grant-writing process.\n    *   **Cons:** May lack the broader strategic perspective of more senior faculty.\n    *   **Best for:** Detailed review, catching typos, clarity, \u0022does this make sense?\u0022\n\n**Key Considerations When Choosing:**\n*   **Balance:** Try to get a mix of deep expertise and broader perspective.\n*   **Time:** Choose people you know are reliable and have a reputation for giving thoughtful feedback.\n*   **Availability:** Reach out early!\n*   **Reciprocity:** If you\u0027ve reviewed for someone, they\u0027re more likely to review for you.\n\n---\n\n### B. Preparing Your Materials (What to Provide)\n\nMake it as easy as possible for your reviewers. The less work they have to do to understand what you need, the more likely they are to help and provide quality feedback.\n\n1.  **The Grant Draft (Well-Organized):**\n    *   **Full Draft:** Include all sections (Aims, Significance, Innovation, Approach, Biosketches, Facilities, etc.). Even if some are rough, it provides context.\n    *   **Page Numbers:** Essential for easy referencing.\n    *   **Version Control:** Clearly label the draft (e.g., \u0022Grant_R01_Draft_v3_Sept15\u0022).\n    *   **Formatting:** Use the agency\u0027s required fonts/margins/line spacing so they can get a realistic feel for length.\n\n2.  **Specific Review Questions/Areas of Focus:**\n    *   **This is CRITICAL.** Don\u0027t just say \u0022please review my grant.\u0022 Guide their feedback.\n    *   **General questions:**\n        *   Is the central hypothesis clear and compelling?\n        *   Are the specific aims logical and achievable within the proposed timeframe?\n        *   Is the significance clearly articulated and persuasive?\n        *   Is the innovation evident and impactful?\n        *   Are there any major flaws or gaps in the experimental design?\n        *   Is the writing clear, concise, and free of jargon?\n        *   Does it meet the page limits?\n        *   What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses?\n    *   **Specific questions for *your* grant:**\n        *   \u0022I\u0027m particularly worried about the feasibility of Aim 2 \u2013 do you think the preliminary data sufficiently supports it?\u0022\n        *   \u0022Is my approach for [complex methodology] clear to someone who isn\u0027t an expert in it?\u0022\n        *   \u0022Does the budget justification adequately support the proposed work?\u0022\n        *   \u0022Is the impact statement strong enough?\u0022\n\n3.  **Relevant Guidelines/Criteria:**\n    *   **Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Link:** Or at least the specific review criteria for your grant mechanism (e.g., NIH\u0027s Significance, Innovation, Approach, Investigator, Environment).\n    *   **Target Reviewer Score Sheet (if available):** Some agencies provide the actual sheet reviewers use. This helps them structure feedback.\n\n4.  **A Clear Timeline:**\n    *   **Your Internal Deadline:** When you need their feedback by (ideally 1-2 weeks before your *own* final internal deadline for revisions, and 3-4 weeks before the *agency\u0027s* submission deadline).\n    *   **Agency Submission Deadline:** For context.\n\n5.  **Brief Project Overview:** A 2-3 sentence summary of your project to include in the email itself.\n\n---\n\n### C. Crafting the Request Email (The Ask)\n\nBe clear, concise, respectful of their time, and make it easy for them to say yes or no.\n\n**Subject Line:**\n*   **Clear and Urgent:** \u0022Grant Review Request - [Your Name] - [Grant Type/Agency] - [Target Date for Feedback]\u0022\n*   *Example:* \u0022Grant Review Request - Dr. Smith - NIH R01 - Feedback by Oct 15\u0022\n\n**Email Body:**\n\nDear [Reviewer\u0027s Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI am writing to humbly request a favor: I am preparing to submit an [Grant Type, e.g., NIH R01, NSF CAREER, internal seed grant] proposal to [Funding Agency, e.g., NIH, NSF, specific foundation] with a target submission date of [Agency Submission Date, e.g., November 5th]. I would be incredibly grateful if you would consider providing an internal review of my draft.\n\n**Project Overview:**\nMy proposal focuses on [brief 2-3 sentence summary of your project and its main goal/significance].\n\n**Why I\u0027m Asking You:**\nYour expertise in [Specific area of their expertise, e.g., \u0022neuroimaging analysis,\u0022 \u0022drug development,\u0022 \u0022educational psychology,\u0022 \u0022your track record with similar awards\u0022] would be incredibly valuable in strengthening this application. I believe your perspective on [specific aspect, e.g., \u0022my proposed statistical approach\u0022 or \u0022the broader impact of this work\u0022] would be particularly insightful.\n\n**What I\u0027m Asking For \u0026 Timeline:**\nThe full draft of the proposal (approx. [X] pages) is attached. I would ideally need comments back by **[Your Internal Deadline - e.g., Friday, October 15th]** to allow me sufficient time for revisions before the final submission.\n\nI completely understand that you are very busy. Even high-level feedback on the clarity of the aims, significance, or overall approach would be immensely helpful. I\u0027ve also included a short list of specific questions I\u0027m wrestling with in the attached document to guide your review, should you have the time.\n\n**Materials Attached/Linked:**\n*   My Grant Proposal Draft (PDF)\n*   Specific Review Questions (Word Doc/PDF)\n*   Link to the [Funding Agency] FOA / Review Criteria (for context)\n\nPlease let me know if this is something you might be able to do. If not, I completely understand, and thank you for considering the request.\n\nI would, of course, be happy to return the favor for any of your upcoming proposals.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Department/Affiliation]\n[Your Email/Phone]\n\n---\n\n**After You Send the Request:**\n\n*   **Follow Up (Gently):** If you don\u0027t hear back in 3-5 business days, send a polite follow-up.\n*   **Be Responsive:** If they agree, thank them promptly and answer any questions they have.\n*   **Be Gracious:** When they send feedback, thank them profusely. Take their feedback seriously, even if you don\u0027t implement every suggestion.\n*   **Offer to Discuss:** Propose a brief meeting (virtual or in-person) to discuss their comments if they prefer.\n*   **Acknowledge Their Help:** A small token of appreciation (a thank you note, coffee, or mention in an \u0022Acknowledgements\u0022 section if allowed and appropriate) can go a long way.\n\nBy being organized, respectful of their time, and clear in your request, you significantly increase your chances of securing valuable internal review for your grant.
