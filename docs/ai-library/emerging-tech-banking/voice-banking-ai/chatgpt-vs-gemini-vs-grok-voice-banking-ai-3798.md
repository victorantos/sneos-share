    "ChatGPT": "Conversational AI in banking refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies to facilitate communication between banks and their customers through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Here are some key aspects of conversational AI in the banking sector:\n\n### 1. **Customer Support and Service:**\n   - **Chatbots**: Banks deploy chatbots on their websites and mobile apps to handle customer inquiries, provide account information, and assist with transactions. These chatbots can operate 24/7, offering immediate assistance without the need for human intervention.\n   - **Voice Assistants**: Conversational AI can also be implemented with voice recognition technologies in mobile banking apps, allowing customers to perform tasks and ask questions using voice commands.\n\n### 2. **Personal Financial Management:**\n   - AI systems can analyze customer data and transaction history to provide personalized insights, budgeting tips, and spending alerts. For example, users might ask, \"How much did I spend on groceries last month?\" and receive a detailed response.\n\n### 3. **Fraud Detection:**\n   - AI can engage in proactive communications with customers. For instance, if unusual activity is detected on an account, the system can initiate a conversation to verify the account holderâ€™s identity and prevent fraud.\n\n### 4. **Loan and Mortgage Applications:**\n   - Conversational AI can guide customers through the loan application process by answering questions and collecting necessary information. It can help users understand their eligibility, terms, and document requirements.\n\n### 5. **Transaction Facilitation:**\n   - Users can use conversational interfaces to initiate transactions, such as transferring money between accounts, paying bills, or making inquiries about their balances.\n\n### 6. **Investment Guidance:**\n   - Chatbots and voice assistants can offer advice and answer questions about investments, retirement accounts, and financial products. It can help customers understand their options and make informed decisions.\n\n### 7. **Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management:**\n   - AI can assist banks in adhering to regulatory requirements by maintaining records of interactions and ensuring that communications are compliant with industry standards.\n\n### 8. **Customer Engagement and Retention:**\n   - By providing fast and effective responses to customer inquiries, conversational AI enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty.
