  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Sure! Here\u0027s a step-by-step guide for setting up a review project and establishing eligibility criteria for your systematic review screening using Covidence or Rayyan.\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Research Question\n\nBefore setting up your project, ensure you have a clearly defined research question. This will guide your eligibility criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Define Eligibility Criteria\n\n**Eligibility criteria** are divided into two major groups: **inclusion criteria** (what studies you will include) and **exclusion criteria** (what studies you will leave out). Here\u2019s how to define them:\n\n1. **Population**: Specify the participants or subjects of the studies. \n   - Example: Adults aged 18-65, patients with disease X, etc.\n\n2. **Intervention**: Describe the interventions or exposures being studied.\n   - Example: Specific drug, therapy, or program.\n\n3. **Comparison**: If applicable, state what the interventions will be compared against.\n   - Example: Placebo, standard care, or no treatment.\n\n4. **Outcome**: Define the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.\n   - Example: Reduction in symptoms, improvement in quality of life, etc.\n\n5. **Study Design**: Specify the types of study designs you will include.\n   - Example: Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, etc.\n\n6. **Time Frame**: Define any time frame related to the studies.\n   - Example: Studies published between 2000 and 2023.\n\n7. **Language**: Decide if you\u0027ll include studies in a specific language.\n   - Example: English language studies only.\n\n8. **Publication Type**: Determine if you\u2019ll include certain types of publications.\n   - Example: Peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up Your Project in Covidence or Rayyan\n\n#### A. Using Covidence\n\n1. **Create an Account/Log In**: Go to Covidence and create an account or log in.\n\n2. **Start a New Review**:\n   - Click on \u201CCreate a new review.\u201D\n   - Fill in your review title and a brief description.\n\n3. **Set Up Eligibility Criteria**:\n   - Go to the \u201CReview Settings\u201D or \u201CEligibility Criteria\u201D section.\n   - Enter your inclusion and exclusion criteria based on what you\u0027ve defined.\n\n4. **Import References**: If you have databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus), export your references and import them into Covidence.\n\n5. **Begin Screening**: Start with the title and abstract screening phase, followed by full-text screening.\n\n#### B. Using Rayyan\n\n1. **Create an Account/Log In**: Visit Rayyan and create an account or log in.\n\n2. **Create a New Review**:\n   - Click on \u201CCreate New Review.\u201D\n   - Name your project appropriately.\n\n3. **Set Up Eligibility Criteria**:\n   - Define the inclusion and exclusion criteria using the text boxes provided.\n   - You can also use tags or labels to categorize studies during screening.\n\n4. **Import References**: Upload your references in supported formats (e.g., PDF, BibTeX).\n\n5. **Screening Process**:\n   - Start screening by applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts.\n   - Use Rayyan\u2019s \u0022blind screening\u0022 feature to minimize bias.\n\n### Step 4: Collaboration\n\nIf you\u0027re working as part of a team, ensure that all team members understand the eligibility criteria. In both tools, you can invite collaborators to help with the screening process.\n\n### Step 5: Documentation\n\nDocument your criteria clearly and keep track of any adjustments made to the criteria during the review process. This is important for maintaining transparency in your systematic review.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnce your project is set up and you\u0027ve defined your eligibility criteria, you can begin the screening process. Make sure to monitor progress, discuss any disagreements among reviewers, and continually refer back to your eligibility criteria. Good luck with your systematic review! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.", "Mistral": "Certainly! Setting up a systematic review project with eligibility criteria in Covidence or Rayyan involves several steps. Below, I\u0027ll guide you through the process for both platforms.\n\n### Using Covidence\n\n#### Step 1: Create an Account\n1. Go to the [Covidence website](https://www.covidence.org/).\n2. Click on \u0022Sign Up\u0022 and follow the instructions to create an account.\n\n#### Step 2: Create a New Review\n1. Log in to your Covidence account.\n2. Click on \u0022Create a new review.\u0022\n3. Enter the title of your review and any additional details.\n4. Click \u0022Create Review.\u0022\n\n#### Step 3: Define Eligibility Criteria\n1. Once your review is created, navigate to the \u0022Settings\u0022 tab.\n2. Click on \u0022Eligibility Criteria.\u0022\n3. Define your inclusion and exclusion criteria. This typically includes:\n   - **Population**: Who are the participants?\n   - **Intervention**: What is the intervention or exposure?\n   - **Comparison**: What is the comparison group?\n   - **Outcome**: What are the outcomes of interest?\n   - **Study Design**: What types of studies are you including (e.g., RCTs, cohort studies)?\n4. Save your criteria.\n\n#### Step 4: Import References\n1. Go to the \u0022Import\u0022 tab.\n2. Upload your references from databases like PubMed, Embase, etc.\n3. Covidence will automatically deduplicate the references.\n\n#### Step 5: Start Screening\n1. Navigate to the \u0022Screening\u0022 tab.\n2. Begin screening titles and abstracts based on your eligibility criteria.\n3. Mark each reference as \u0022Include,\u0022 \u0022Exclude,\u0022 or \u0022Maybe.\u0022\n\n### Using Rayyan\n\n#### Step 1: Create an Account\n1. Go to the [Rayyan website](https://www.rayyan.ai/).\n2. Click on \u0022Sign Up\u0022 and follow the instructions to create an account.\n\n#### Step 2: Create a New Review\n1.
