  :responses='{"Grok": "It looks like your query got cut off\u2014I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re looking for help with using citation plugins like the Zotero Connector (a popular browser extension for managing and inserting citations into documents). I\u0027ll provide a step-by-step guide based on common usage. If this isn\u0027t what you meant, feel free to clarify!\n\n### What is Zotero Connector?\nZotero is a free, open-source tool for collecting, organizing, and citing research sources. The Zotero Connector is its browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) that lets you:\n- Save references from web pages (e.g., articles, books) directly to your Zotero library.\n- Insert citations and generate bibliographies in word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup and Usage\n1. **Install Zotero and the Connector**:\n   - Download and install the Zotero desktop app from [zotero.org/download](https://www.zotero.org/download).\n   - Install the Zotero Connector extension from your browser\u0027s extension store:\n     - Chrome/Edge: Search for \u0022Zotero Connector\u0022 in the Chrome Web Store.\n     - Firefox: Search in Add-ons. (It\u0027s officially called the same.)\n     - Safari: Download from zotero.org.\n   - Sync your Zotero library by creating a free account at [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org) and signing in on both desktop and browser.\n\n2. **Saving Citations from the Web**:\n   - Browse to a webpage with a source (e.g., a journal article on JSTOR, Google Scholar, or a news site).\n   - Click the Zotero Connector icon in your browser toolbar (it looks like a paper with a folder).\n   - Select the item type (e.g., \u0022Journal Article\u0022) and any details it auto-detects.\n   - The reference will save to your Zotero library. Edit details (like tags or notes) in the desktop app.\n\n3. **Inserting Citations in Documents**:\n   - Install the Zotero plugin for your word processor:\n     - **Microsoft Word**: In Zotero desktop, go to Edit \u003E Preferences \u003E Cite \u003E Word Processors \u003E Install Microsoft Word Add-in.\n     - **Google Docs**: Use the Zotero Connector directly\u2014click the Zotero icon in Docs, search your library, and insert.\n     - **LibreOffice**: Similar to Word; install via Zotero preferences.\n   - Open your document.\n   - In Word/Docs: Place your cursor where you want the citation, then use the Zotero toolbar (or Tools \u003E Add/Edit Citation in Docs) to search and insert items from your library.\n   - Generate a bibliography: Use the \u0022Add/Edit Bibliography\u0022 option to auto-format it in styles like APA, MLA, Chicago, etc. (over 10,000 styles available).\n\n4. **Tips and Troubleshooting**:\n   - **Sync Issues**: Ensure you\u0027re signed in and syncing across devices. Libraries can hold unlimited items with Zotero\u0027s free storage (300MB), or upgrade for more.\n   - **Supported Sites**: The Connector works best on academic databases (PubMed, arXiv) but may need manual entry for others.\n   - **Advanced Features**: Use Zotero\u0027s groups for collaboration, or integrate with tools like Overleaf for LaTeX.\n   - Common Errors: If the icon doesn\u0027t appear, restart your browser or reinstall the extension. For plugin issues, check Zotero\u0027s help forums at [forums.zotero.org](https://forums.zotero.org).\n   - Privacy Note: Zotero doesn\u0027t track your data; everything stays local unless you sync.\n\nFor more details, check the official docs at [zotero.org/support](https://www.zotero.org/support). If you\u0027re using it with a specific platform (e.g., WordPress via plugins like WP-Zotero) or need help with alternatives like Mendeley or EndNote, let me know!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
