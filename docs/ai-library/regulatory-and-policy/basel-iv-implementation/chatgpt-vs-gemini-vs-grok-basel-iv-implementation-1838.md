  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Basel IV refers to the set of reform measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) aimed at enhancing the regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking sector. These measures build upon the Basel III framework and address several key areas, including risk-weighted assets (RWAs), capital requirements, and the implementation of internal models.\n\n### Key Aspects of Internal Models under Basel IV\n\n1. **Standardized Approaches**: Basel IV encourages increased standardization for the calculation of capital requirements. This includes the introduction of revised approaches for credit risk, operational risk, and the leverage ratio.\n\n2. **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approaches**: Banks using internal models to estimate credit risk can adopt the IRB approaches. Basel IV enhances regulations around IRB models, ensuring that they are more conservative and better aligned with standardized approaches.\n\n3. **Model Limitations**: Basel IV introduces constraints on how banks can use internal models for risk assessment. For example, it may require that banks apply a floor to model outcomes, ensuring that internal estimations do not fall below a certain percentage of the standardized measurements.\n\n4. **Capital Floors**: A significant feature of Basel IV is the introduction of capital floors that require banks to maintain capital levels based on predefined standardized approaches, even if their internal models suggest lower capital requirements. This means that the outputs of internal models will be limited to ensure consistency and reduce risk of undercapitalization.\n\n5. **Simplified Model Approval**: Basel IV may require banks to provide more transparency and robustness in their internal model development and validation processes. Banks will face more stringent criteria for model approval, increasing regulatory scrutiny of internal models to ensure they accurately reflect underlying risks.\n\n6. **Operational Risk Management**: Basel IV introduces a more standardized approach for calculating operational risk capital, moving away from the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA) formerly available to many banks.\n\n7. **Stress Testing and Backtesting**: Banks will be required to conduct robust stress testing and backtesting of their internal models to ensure they accurately capture potential risks and maintain capital adequacy during stressed conditions.\n\n8. **Supervisory Review**: There will be an increased focus on supervisory review of banksâ€™ internal models, with regulators exercising heightened due diligence in the validation and ongoing assessment of these models.\n\n### Overall Goals of Basel IV\n\nThe overall goals of Basel IV, including adjustments related to internal models, are to:\n- Enhance the resilience of the banking sector against financial stress.\n- Improve transparency and comparability in risk-weighted capital measurement.\n- Ensure that banks hold sufficient capital against their risks to promote financial stability.\n- Address shortcomings identified during the Basel III implementation and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBanks will need to carefully consider how these Basel IV regulations impact their internal models and risk management frameworks, adapting to the new standards while remaining compliant and competitive.", "Gemini": "## Internal Models and Basel IV\n\nInternal models play a significant role in Basel IV, the latest iteration of the Basel Accords, primarily for calculating regulatory capital requirements. While Basel IV aims to reduce reliance on internal models in favor of standardized approaches, they aren\u0027t entirely eliminated. Here\u0027s a breakdown:\n\n**Key Changes in Basel IV Regarding Internal Models:**\n\n* **Reduced Scope of Use:** Basel IV significantly reduces the scope for using internal models, particularly for credit risk. This is a major shift from previous versions of Basel, where internal models (like the Advanced Internal Ratings Based approach - AIRB) were widely used by larger, more sophisticated banks.\n* **Focus on Standardized Approaches:** Basel IV emphasizes standardized approaches (SA) for calculating capital requirements. These approaches are designed to be simpler and more consistent across institutions, reducing the risk of model manipulation and promoting comparability.\n* **Restrictions and Limitations on Internal Models:** Even where internal models are permitted, Basel IV imposes tighter restrictions and limitations. This includes:\n * **Floor on Internal Model Outputs:** A key element is the output floor, which states that banks\u0027 risk-weighted assets (RWAs) calculated using internal models cannot be lower than a certain percentage (initially 72.5%) of the RWAs calculated using the standardized approaches. This effectively limits the capital benefits of using internal models.\n * **Enhanced Model Validation and Governance:** Basel IV requires stronger model validation, governance, and risk management frameworks for banks that continue to use internal models. This includes more frequent reviews and more robust processes for identifying and addressing model weaknesses.\n * **Stricter Input Data Requirements:** Basel IV specifies more rigorous requirements for the data used as inputs for internal models, improving data quality and consistency.\n\n**Areas Where Internal Models Remain Relevant (though often restricted):**\n\n* **Market Risk:** Internal models are still permitted for calculating market risk capital, but with significant revisions to the market risk framework (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book - FRTB). The FRTB introduces a standardized approach alongside the internal models approach, but the internal models approach is subject to stringent requirements.\n* **Operational Risk:** Basel IV eliminates the use of internal models for calculating operational risk capital. Banks are required to use the standardized approach.\n* **Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk:** While the standardized approach is the primary method, internal models are still permitted for CVA risk under certain conditions, but these models are subject to constraints and must meet stringent requirements.\n\n**Reasons for the Shift Away from Internal Models:**\n\n* **Complexity and Inconsistency:** Internal models can be highly complex and difficult to validate. This has led to inconsistencies in capital requirements across different banks, even for similar portfolios.\n* **Model Risk:** Banks relying heavily on internal models are exposed to significant model risk, the risk of financial loss arising from errors or deficiencies in model design, implementation, or use.\n* **Gaming the System:** Some banks were accused of using internal models to artificially lower their capital requirements, which undermined the integrity of the regulatory framework.\n* **Lack of Comparability:** The complexity and diversity of internal models made it difficult to compare the risk profiles of different banks.\n\n**Implications for Banks:**\n\n* **Increased Capital Requirements:** The shift towards standardized approaches and the introduction of the output floor are expected to increase capital requirements for many banks, particularly those that previously relied heavily on internal models.\n* **Investment in Standardized Approaches:** Banks will need to invest in implementing and maintaining the standardized approaches, including data collection and reporting systems.\n* **Review of Internal Model Strategy:** Banks need to carefully review their internal model strategy and assess the cost-benefit of maintaining internal models versus relying solely on standardized approaches.\n* **Focus on Data Quality and Model Governance:** Banks that continue to use internal models will need to strengthen their data quality and model governance frameworks to meet the enhanced requirements of Basel IV.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nBasel IV significantly reduces the reliance on internal models, primarily for credit risk and operational risk. While internal models are still permitted in certain areas (notably market risk and, to a lesser extent, CVA risk), they are subject to stricter requirements, limitations, and the overall output floor. This shift aims to promote greater consistency, comparability, and transparency in capital regulation across banks globally. The impact of Basel IV on individual banks will depend on their current use of internal models and their ability to adapt to the new requirements.\n", "Grok": "The term \u0022internal models\u0022 in the context of Basel IV refers to the methodologies and frameworks that banks use to calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and regulatory capital requirements for credit, market, and operational risks under the Basel framework. Basel IV, while not an official term, generally refers to the finalized Basel III reforms and enhancements agreed upon by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2017, often called the \u0022Basel III Endgame.\u0022 These reforms, set to be implemented starting from January 2023 (with phased-in timelines in many jurisdictions), aim to reduce excessive variability in RWAs and improve the comparability of risk assessments across banks.\n\n### Internal Models Under Basel IV\nUnder the Basel framework, banks with sufficient sophistication and regulatory approval can use internal models to estimate risks and calculate capital requirements, as opposed to relying on standardized approaches. Basel IV introduces significant changes to the use of internal models, aiming to address concerns about their complexity, lack of transparency, and variability in outcomes.\n\nHere are the key aspects of internal models under Basel IV for different risk types:\n\n1. **Credit Risk - Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach**:\n - Basel IV imposes stricter constraints on the use of internal models for credit risk under the IRB approach to reduce variability in RWAs.\n - Key changes include:\n - **Removal of Advanced IRB (A-IRB) for certain exposures**: Banks are no longer allowed to use A-IRB for exposures to large corporates, banks, and other financial institutions with total assets above a certain threshold (e.g., \u20AC50 billion). Instead, the Foundation IRB (F-IRB) or standardized approach must be used.\n - **Parameter floors**: For portfolios where internal models are still allowed, Basel IV introduces input floors for key parameters like Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). For example, PD floors are set at 0.05% for corporate exposures.\n - **Output floor**: Basel IV introduces an overall output floor of 72.5% of the RWAs calculated under the standardized approach. This means that even if a bank\u0027s internal model calculates lower RWAs, the final capital requirement cannot be less than 72.5% of the RWAs under the standardized approach.\n - These changes aim to limit excessive optimism in internal models and enhance comparability across banks.\n\n2. **Market Risk - Internal Model Approach (IMA)**:\n - For market risk, Basel IV builds on the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), which was finalized as part of the Basel III reforms.\n - Banks can use internal models for market risk, but the framework is more stringent:\n - **Expected Shortfall (ES)**: Replaces Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the primary risk measure, focusing on tail risk over a 97.5% confidence level.\n - **Liquidity horizons**: Risk factors are assigned different liquidity horizons, reflecting how long it would take to unwind positions in stressed market conditions.\n - **Model approval and backtesting**: Stricter criteria for model approval, including desk-level validation and backtesting requirements. Desks failing backtesting must revert to the standardized approach.\n - **Non-modellable risk factors (NMRFs)**: Risk factors that cannot be adequately modeled must be capitalized using a stress scenario approach, increasing capital requirements.\n - The goal is to ensure that internal models for market risk are robust and capture tail risks more effectively.\n\n3. **Operational Risk - Internal Models Prohibited**:\n - One of the most significant changes in Basel IV is the complete elimination of internal models (Advanced Measurement Approaches, AMA) for operational risk.\n - Instead, all banks must use the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA), which combines a business indicator component (based on income) with a historical loss component (based on a bank\u2019s own loss experience).\n - This change was driven by the high variability and subjectivity in internal models for operational risk, as well as challenges in validating these models.\n\n### Key Objectives of Changes to Internal Models in Basel IV\nThe reforms to internal models under Basel IV are designed to address several issues identified in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent assessments of Basel III:\n- **Reduce variability in RWAs**: Internal models often produced significantly different RWAs for similar exposures across banks, undermining comparability and confidence in capital ratios.\n- **Enhance credibility**: By imposing floors and standardized approaches, Basel IV aims to ensure that capital requirements are not understated.\n- **Limit model risk**: Over-reliance on complex models can lead to errors or manipulation, so Basel IV introduces constraints to balance model use with standardized methods.\n- **Improve transparency**: Greater reliance on standardized approaches and mandatory disclosures makes it easier for regulators and stakeholders to understand and compare capital adequacy.\n\n### Challenges for Banks Using Internal Models\n- **Increased capital requirements**: The output floor and parameter floors often result in higher RWAs, requiring banks to hold more capital.\n- **Operational burden**: Revising or phasing out internal models (e.g., for operational risk) requires significant investment in systems, data, and processes to comply with new standardized approaches.\n- **Loss of competitive advantage**: Banks that previously benefited from lower capital requirements through optimized internal models may face a level playing field with smaller or less sophisticated banks using standardized approaches.\n- **Regulatory scrutiny**: Banks must meet stricter criteria for model approval and ongoing validation, increasing compliance costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nUnder Basel IV, internal models remain an important tool for sophisticated banks to calculate capital requirements, particularly for credit and market risk. However, their use is heavily constrained through parameter floors, output floors, and outright prohibitions (e.g., for operational risk). These changes reflect a shift toward standardization and conservatism in the Basel framework, aiming to strengthen the global banking system\u0027s resilience while addressing the limitations of internal models. Banks must adapt to these changes by recalibrating their models, enhancing data quality, and preparing for higher capital requirements. Implementation timelines and specific requirements may vary by jurisdiction, as national regulators (e.g., the European Union, U.S., or others) adopt Basel IV into local rules. For instance, the EU\u0027s CRR III/CRD VI and the U.S. Federal Reserve\u0027s proposals reflect tailored approaches to these global standards.\n\nIf you have a specific aspect of internal models or Basel IV (e.g., a particular risk type or jurisdiction) you\u0027d like to explore further, let me know!"}'
