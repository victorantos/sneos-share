    "DeepSeek": "Of course. \u00221071 reporting deadlines\u0022 refer to the new requirements under **Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act**, which mandates that financial institutions collect and report data about their small business lending.\n\nThe deadlines are complex because they are **staggered** based on the volume of a lender\u0027s small business loans.\n\nHere is a clear breakdown of the key deadlines and what they mean.\n\n### Key Summary of Deadlines\n\nThe compliance dates are based on how many **\u0022covered originations\u0022** a lender made in each of the two preceding calendar years. A \u0022covered origination\u0022 is generally a closed-end loan or line of credit to a small business.\n\n| Lender Tier (by # of Covered Originations) | Compliance Date (Deadline to Start Data Collection) | First Data Reporting Deadline |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Tier 1:** 2,500\u002B loans in both 2022 \u0026 2023 | **October 1, 2024** | **June 1, 2026** (for data from Oct 1, 2024 - Dec 31, 2025) |\n| **Tier 2:** 500\u002B loans in both 2022 \u0026 2023 | **April 1, 2025** | **June 1, 2026** (for data from Apr 1, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025) |\n| **Tier 3:** 100\u002B loans in both 2022 \u0026 2023 | **January 1, 2026** | **June 1, 2027** (for data from Jan 1, 2026 - Dec 31, 2026) |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Each Deadline\n\nThere are two main types of deadlines to understand: when you start **collecting data** and when you start **reporting it**.\n\n#### 1. Data Collection Start Date\n\nThis is the date by which your institution must have its systems and processes in place to begin recording the required data points for every covered application.\n\n*   **Tier 1 (Major Lenders): October 1, 2024**\n    *   You are in this tier if you originated **at least 2,500** covered small business loans in **both** 2022 and 2023.\n*   **Tier 2 (Medium Lenders): April 1, 2025**\n    *   You are in this tier if you originated **at least 500** (but fewer than 2,500) covered small business loans in **both** 2022 and 2023.\n*   **Tier 3 (Smaller Lenders): January 1, 2026**\n    *   You are in this tier if you originated **at least 100** (but fewer than 500) covered small business loans in **both** 2022 and 2023.\n\n\u003E **Important Note:** Lenders that originated fewer than 100 covered originations in both of the two preceding calendar years are **exempt** from these rules.\n\n#### 2. Data Reporting Deadline\n\nThis is the date by which you must submit your collected data to the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**.\n\n*   The reporting is done **annually**, by **June 1** of the following year.\n*   The **first reporting deadline for all lenders is June 1, 2026**.\n    *   **Tier 1 lenders** will report data collected from **October 1, 2024, to December 31, 2025**.\n    *   **Tier 2 lenders** will report data collected from **April 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025**.\n*   **Tier 3 lenders** begin reporting on **June 1, 2027**, for their full 2026 calendar year data.\n\n### What Data Needs to Be Collected and Reported?\n\nThe rule requires the collection of a wide range of data points for each application, including:\n\n*   **Application Details:** Date, type, amount, action taken (approved/denied), etc.\n*   **Loan Details:** Credit pricing (interest rate, total costs), guarantees, etc.\n*   **Demographic Information:** The race, ethnicity, and sex of the business\u0027s principal owners. This is a critical and new requirement.\n*   **Business Details:** Industry, number of employees, annual revenue.\n*   **Census Tract:** The location of the business.\n\n### Why is This Happening?\n\nThe goal of Section 1071 is to:\n*   Identify business and community development needs for women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses.\n*   Facilitate enforcement of fair lending laws.\n*   Enable communities, lenders, and policymakers to better understand the market for small business credit.\n\n### Action Steps for Lenders\n\n1.  **Determine Your Tier:** Immediately assess your number of \u0022covered originations\u0022 for 2022 and 2023 to know your compliance date.\n2.  **Update Systems:** Begin modifying your loan origination systems, application forms, and procedures to capture all required data points.\n3.  **Develop Procedures:** Create a compliant process for collecting demographic data from applicants.\n4.  **Train Staff:** Ensure all staff involved in the lending process are trained on the new requirements.\n5.  **Plan for Reporting:** Develop the internal capability to compile and submit the data to the CFPB by the annual June 1 deadline.\n\nFor the most authoritative information, always refer to the **official CFPB Rule and Resources**:\n[CFPB Section 1071 Rule Implementation Page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/small-business-lending-under-ecoa-section-1071/)\n\n***Disclaimer:** I am an AI assistant and this information is for general guidance only. It is not legal advice. You should consult with qualified legal and compliance professionals to understand how these deadlines and rules apply to your specific institution.*",
    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down the reporting deadlines related to Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates the collection and reporting of small business lending data.\n\n**Key Dates to Remember:**\n\n*   **Compliance Date (When you must *start* collecting data):**  This is the crucial date. You need to have systems and processes in place to accurately gather the required information from applicants.\n\n    *   The compliance date is tiered based on the number of covered transactions originated by the financial institution in each of the two preceding calendar years:\n\n        *   **Tier 1 (Most Institutions):** Institutions that originated at least 100 covered small business credit applications in both 2022 and 2023 must comply with Section 1071 starting **October 1, 2024.**\n\n        *   **Tier 2:** Institutions that originated at least 50 covered small business credit applications, but fewer than 100, in both 2022 and 2023 must comply starting **April 1, 2025.**\n\n        *   **Tier 3:** Institutions that originated fewer than 50 covered small business credit applications in both 2022 and 2023 must comply starting **January 1, 2026.**\n\n*   **Reporting Deadline (When you must *submit* the data):**  This is when you actually submit the collected data to the CFPB.\n\n    *   The data must be submitted **annually, by June 1st of the following year.**  For example:\n\n        *   For data collected from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 (for Tier 1), and then for the full year of 2025, the first reporting deadline is **June 1, 2026.**\n        *   For data collected from April 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025 (for Tier 2), and then for the full year of 2026, the first reporting deadline is **June 1, 2027.**\n        *   For data collected from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2026 (for Tier 3), the first reporting deadline is **June 1, 2027.**\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1.  **Determine your Tier:** Count the number of covered small business credit applications your institution originated in both 2022 and 2023. This will determine your compliance date.\n2.  **Start Collecting Data:**  Be ready to collect the required data from *every* covered application *on or after* your compliance date.\n3.  **Submit Annually:**  Report the collected data to the CFPB by June 1st of the following calendar year, beginning with the data collected in the partial or full calendar year that includes your compliance date.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **\u0022Covered Application\u0022:**  This refers to an application for credit primarily for small business purposes, as defined by the regulation.  Understanding the definition of a \u0022small business\u0022 and what constitutes a \u0022credit application\u0022 is critical.\n*   **Data Points:**  Section 1071 requires collecting a significant amount of data, including information about the applicant (e.g., demographics, revenue) and the loan terms.  Make sure you understand *all* the data points that you need to collect.\n*   **CFPB Resources:** The CFPB has released extensive resources, including the final rule, interpretive guidance, and small entity compliance guides.  Refer to the CFPB\u0027s website ([www.consumerfinance.gov](www.consumerfinance.gov)) for the most up-to-date information.\n*   **Good Faith Efforts:**  There are rules about obtaining demographic information from applicants. You need to make \u0022good faith efforts\u0022 to collect this information, but you cannot deny a loan if the applicant refuses to provide it.  You will need to document your efforts.\n*   **Privacy:** The CFPB has rules about how you must protect the privacy of applicants, particularly regarding the collection and use of demographic information.\n*   **Amendments and Updates:**  Regulations can change.  Stay informed about any amendments or updates to the Section 1071 rule. The CFPB\u0027s website is the best source for this information.\n*   **Consult with Counsel:**  Given the complexity of the regulation, it\u0027s highly recommended that you consult with legal counsel to ensure full compliance.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet\u0027s say \u0022Acme Bank\u0022 originated 75 covered small business credit applications in 2022 and 80 in 2023.\n\n*   Acme Bank falls into **Tier 2.**\n*   Their **compliance date is April 1, 2025.** They must begin collecting 1071 data on all covered applications received on or after this date.\n*   Their first reporting period will be from April 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, and then the full year of 2026.\n*   Acme Bank\u0027s **first reporting deadline is June 1, 2027.**\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Start planning now!**  Even if your compliance date is further out, don\u0027t wait. The implementation process can be complex and time-consuming.\n*   **Review the CFPB\u0027s resources thoroughly.**\n*   **Identify the systems and processes you need to put in place.**  This includes training staff, updating your loan origination system, and establishing procedures for data collection and reporting.\n*   **Consider using technology solutions** designed to help with 1071 compliance.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps!  Let me know if you have any other questions.\n",
