    "Grok": "Computational geometry is a branch of computer science and mathematics that deals with algorithms for solving geometric problems. It focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for tasks involving geometric objects such as points, lines, polygons, and more complex shapes in 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions. These algorithms are widely used in fields like computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), and more.\n\nBelow is an overview of key concepts, problems, and algorithms in computational geometry:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Fundamental Concepts**\n- **Geometric Primitives**: Points, lines, line segments, rays, polygons, circles, and polyhedra.\n- **Convexity**: A set is convex if the line segment connecting any two points in the set lies entirely within the set. Convex shapes (like convex hulls) are often easier to work with in computational geometry.\n- **Coordinate Systems**: Many algorithms operate in Cartesian coordinates, though polar or other systems can be used for specific problems.\n- **Precision Issues**: Floating-point arithmetic can lead to errors in geometric computations, so robust algorithms often use exact arithmetic or handle numerical stability carefully.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Core Problems in Computational Geometry**\nHere are some fundamental problems and the algorithms used to solve them:\n\n#### a. **Convex Hull**\n- **Problem**: Given a set of points in a plane, compute the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.\n- **Algorithms**:\n  - **Graham\u0027s Scan**: O(n log n) time.

Iteratively removes \u0022ears\u0022 (triangles with no internal points).\n  - **Delaunay Triangulation**: Maximizes the minimum angle of triangles. Often computed via incremental insertion or divide-and-conquer in O(n log n) time.\n- **Applications**: Mesh generation, terrain modeling, and finite element analysis.\n\n#### e. **Voronoi Diagrams**\n- **Problem**: Partition the plane into regions based on proximity to a set of points (each region contains all points closer to a specific input point than to any other).\n- **Algorithms**:\n  -
