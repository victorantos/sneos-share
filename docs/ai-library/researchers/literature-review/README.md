## 💡 Best Practices for Using AI in Literature Review

### Do's ✅
1. **Verify every citation** - AI can hallucinate references
2. **Use AI for initial screening** - Then read key papers yourself
3. **Combine tools** - Use specialized tools for search, general AI for synthesis
4. **Maintain academic rigor** - AI is a tool, not a substitute for critical thinking
5. **Document your process** - Be transparent about AI use in your methodology

### Don'ts ❌
1. **Don't trust citations blindly** - Always verify
2. **Don't skip reading primary sources** - AI summaries miss nuances
3. **Don't rely on a single tool** - Cross-check with multiple sources
4. **Don't forget recency bias** - AI has knowledge cutoffs
5. **Don't ignore your discipline's norms** - Check if AI use requires disclosure

## 🔧 Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)
1. Use **Google Scholar** or **Semantic Scholar** for initial search

3. Use **Connected Papers** or **Research Rabbit** for citation mapping

### Phase 2: Screening (Week 2-3)
1. Use AI to summarize abstracts and identify relevant papers
2. Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria manually
3. Use AI to extract key information into your literature matrix

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Week 3-4)
1. Read key papers thoroughly yourself
2. Use AI to identify themes across multiple papers
3. Use AI to help organize your literature review structure

### Phase 4: Writing (Week 4-5)
