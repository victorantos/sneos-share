# Research Methodology: SNEOS AI Comparison Framework

This document explains our systematic approach to comparing AI models, ensuring reliable, transparent, and academically rigorous evaluations across **2100+ comparisons**.

## üéØ Methodology Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Systematic Evaluation** - Standardized prompts and evaluation criteria
2. **Transparency** - All prompts and responses publicly available
3. **Reproducibility** - Comparisons can be replicated by anyone
4. **Bias Awareness** - Acknowledge limitations and potential biases
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular methodology updates

### Research Questions

Our comparison framework addresses:
- Which AI model performs best for specific tasks?
- What are the strengths and limitations of each model?
- How do models compare across different use cases?
- Which model offers best value for specific users?

## üìä Evaluation Framework

### 1. Prompt Design

**Standardization:**
- Each comparison uses identical prompts across all models
- Prompts designed to test specific capabilities
- Scenarios reflect real-world use cases
- Complexity calibrated to task requirements

**Prompt Categories:**

| Category | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Factual Knowledge** | "Explain quantum entanglement" | Test accuracy & depth |
| **Analytical Reasoning** | "Compare approaches to..." | Test logic & synthesis |
| **Creative Generation** | "Write a research proposal..." | Test creativity & originality |
| **Technical Skills** | "Write Python code for..." | Test domain expertise |
| **Ethical Reasoning** | "Analyze ethical implications..." | Test moral reasoning |

### 2. Model Testing Protocol

**Test Environment:**
- Same date and time for all models (when possible)
- Default model settings (temperature, etc.)
- No fine-tuning or custom instructions
- Fresh conversation context

**Models Evaluated:**
- ChatGPT (GPT-4 series) - OpenAI
- Claude (Sonnet/Opus series) - Anthropic
- Gemini (Pro/Advanced series) - Google
- Grok - xAI
- DeepSeek - DeepSeek
- Mistral AI - Mistral

**Version Tracking:**
- Model versions documented when available
- Comparisons dated to reflect model capabilities at time of testing
- Major version changes trigger re-evaluation

### 3. Evaluation Dimensions

#### Academic Research Criteria

**Accuracy & Factual Correctness**
- Factual accuracy (verified against authoritative sources)
- Citation accuracy (when provided)
- Acknowledgment of uncertainty
- Handling of controversial topics

**Depth & Comprehensiveness**
- Level of detail
- Coverage of relevant aspects
- Integration of multiple perspectives
- Handling of complexity

**Analytical Quality**
- Logical coherence
- Critical thinking
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Recognition of limitations

**Methodological Soundness**
- Research design appropriateness
- Statistical reasoning
- Recognition of confounds
- Ethical considerations

**Writing Quality**
- Clarity and organization
- Academic tone and style
- Grammar and mechanics
- Citation formatting (when applicable)

#### Practical Considerations

**Usability**
- Response time
- Ease of understanding
- Actionability
- Follow-up question handling

**Versatility**
- Cross-domain performance
- Adaptation to user needs
- Handling of ambiguity

**Value**
- Cost vs. performance
- Access and availability
- Rate limits and restrictions

## üî¨ Quality Assurance

### Internal Validation

**Multi-Reviewer Approach:**
- Comparisons reviewed by multiple team members when possible
- Domain experts consulted for specialized topics
- Peer review process for major comparisons

**Consistency Checks:**
- Cross-comparison consistency
- Temporal stability (re-testing over time)
- Inter-rater reliability for subjective evaluations

### External Validation

**Community Feedback:**
- GitHub repository for issue reporting
- User comments and corrections
- Expert review solicitation

**Reproducibility:**
- All prompts publicly available
- Anyone can re-run comparisons on SNEOS.com
- Encourage independent verification

## üìù Data Collection & Analysis

### Data Structure

Each comparison includes:
```
- Unique ID
- Date of comparison
- Prompt text
- Model responses (complete, unedited)
- Model versions (when available)
- Category/tags
- Comparison metadata
```

### Analysis Approach

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Thematic analysis of response patterns
- Identification of model-specific strengths
- Pattern recognition across use cases
- Critical incident identification

**Quantitative Metrics (where applicable):**
- Response length
- Response time
- Factual accuracy scores
- Code functionality (for programming tasks)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations & Biases

### Acknowledged Limitations

**Prompt Dependency:**
- Results depend on specific prompts used
- Different phrasings may yield different results
- No single prompt can fully capture capability

**Temporal Limitations:**
- Models continuously updated
- Comparisons reflect specific point in time
- Regular updates needed

**Evaluator Subjectivity:**
- Some criteria require subjective judgment
- Reviewer expertise and perspective matter
- Inter-rater reliability not perfect

**Resource Constraints:**
- Cannot test all possible use cases
- Time and cost limitations
- Focus on English language primarily

### Potential Biases

**Selection Bias:**
- Categories reflect perceived user interest
- May not cover all niche use cases
- Platform bias (testing on public interfaces)

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Risk of seeing what we expect to see
- Mitigated through structured evaluation
- External review encouraged

**Recency Bias:**
- Newer models may receive more attention
- Historical comparisons may be outdated
- Regular re-evaluation needed
