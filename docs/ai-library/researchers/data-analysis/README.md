- Optimizing performance

### What Requires Caution

‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex Modeling**
- Advanced statistical models may need verification
- Bayesian analysis can be hit-or-miss
- Custom models require careful review

‚ö†Ô∏è **Interpretation**
- AI may over-interpret results
- Context-specific interpretations need human judgment
- Causality claims should be carefully evaluated

‚ö†Ô∏è **Method Selection**
- May suggest standard methods when custom approaches needed
- Doesn't always consider your specific research context

## üíª Programming Language Support

### Python
**Best AI Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek
- Excellent for pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- Strong visualization support (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Good for machine learning (scikit-learn, statsmodels)

### R
**Best AI Tools:** Claude, ChatGPT
- Excellent for tidyverse workflows
- Strong ggplot2 support
- Good for statistical modeling (lm, glm, mixed models)

### STATA
**Best AI Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude
- Good for basic STATA commands
- Limited compared to Python/R support

### SPSS
**Best AI Tools:** ChatGPT
- Basic syntax help
- Point-and-click alternative: use R with AI assistance

## üé® Data Visualization

### Publication-Ready Figures

**Best Tools:** Claude, ChatGPT

Example prompts:
- "Create a publication-ready boxplot in R using ggplot2"
- "Generate Python code for a professional-looking regression plot"
- "Make this plot APA style compliant"

### Interactive Visualizations

**Best Tools:** ChatGPT, Gemini

- Plotly and D3.js support
- Dashboard creation (Shiny, Streamlit)
- Interactive exploration tools

## üîç Qualitative Data Analysis

### Thematic Analysis

**Best Tools:** Claude, ChatGPT

Capabilities:
- Initial coding assistance
- Theme identification
- Code organization and hierarchies
- Quote selection

**Workflow:**
1. Upload transcript excerpt to AI
2. Ask for initial codes
3. Review and refine codes
4. Develop themes with AI assistance
5. Write up analysis yourself

### Important Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Context is Key** - AI doesn't understand your research context fully
‚úÖ **Human Oversight Essential** - Always review and validate AI-suggested codes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Privacy Concerns** - Be careful with sensitive data
‚úÖ **Transparency** - Document AI use in your methodology

## üìã Recommended Workflows

### Quantitative Analysis Workflow

**Week 1: Data Prep**
```
1. Ask AI to help write data cleaning code
2. Generate descriptive statistics
3. Check data quality and assumptions
4. Create exploratory visualizations
```

**Week 2: Analysis**
```
1. Consult AI on appropriate statistical tests
2. Generate analysis code
3. Run analyses and check outputs
4. Troubleshoot any issues with AI help
```

**Week 3: Visualization & Reporting**
```
1. Create publication-ready figures
2. Generate results tables
3. Ask AI to help interpret outputs
4. Write methods section with AI assistance
```

### Qualitative Analysis Workflow

**Phase 1: Familiarization** (AI-Optional)
```
1. Read transcripts yourself
2. Take initial notes
3. Optionally ask AI for initial impressions
```

**Phase 2: Initial Coding** (AI-Assisted)
```
1. Code subset of data yourself
2. Use AI to suggest codes for remaining data
3. Review and refine all AI-suggested codes
4. Develop codebook
```

**Phase 3: Theme Development** (AI-Assisted)
```
1. Use AI to identify potential themes
2. Critically evaluate suggested themes
3. Refine themes with your domain expertise
4. Select representative quotes (AI can help)
```

**Phase 4: Write-Up** (Minimal AI)
```
1. Write analysis yourself
2. Use AI for editing and clarity
3. Verify all claims with data
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy Considerations

### Safe Practices

‚úÖ **De-identify data** before sharing with AI
‚úÖ **Use enterprise versions** for sensitive research
‚úÖ **Check your IRB** - requirements vary by institution
‚úÖ **Don't upload** identifiable information

### Tools with Better Privacy

- **ChatGPT Team/Enterprise** - Data not used for training
- **Claude Pro** - Similar privacy protections
- **Local LLMs** - Complete data control (but less capable)

### Use Case 2: Interview Analysis

**Scenario:** Thematic analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews

**AI Assistance:**
- Initial coding suggestions
- Identifying patterns across interviews
- Organizing codes into themes
- Suggesting representative quotes

### Use Case 3: Mixed Methods Integration

**Scenario:** Integrating quantitative survey with qualitative interview data

**AI Assistance:**
- Suggesting integration strategies
- Identifying convergent/divergent findings
- Creating joint displays
- Writing integrated findings
