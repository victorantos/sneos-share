## üìö Key Capabilities

### What AI Does Well

‚úÖ **Case Summarization** - Excellent at extracting key facts, holdings, and reasoning
‚úÖ **Legal Analysis** - Strong at identifying legal issues and applying rules
‚úÖ **Comparative Analysis** - Good at comparing multiple cases or statutes
‚úÖ **Writing Assistance** - Helpful for drafting and editing legal prose
‚úÖ **Research Starting Points** - Great for understanding new areas of law

### Critical Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Citation Accuracy** - AI FREQUENTLY hallucinates case citations - ALWAYS VERIFY
‚ö†Ô∏è **Currency** - Knowledge cutoff means missing recent cases
‚ö†Ô∏è **Jurisdictional Nuances** - May miss jurisdiction-specific rules
‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Issues** - Some bar associations have specific AI rules
‚ö†Ô∏è **Unauthorized Practice** - Cannot replace licensed attorney advice

## üí° Best Practices for Academic Legal Research

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Verify Every Citation** - Use Westlaw, Lexis, or Google Scholar to confirm
2. **Check Current Law** - AI has knowledge cutoffs
3. **Use for Brainstorming** - Excellent for generating research ideas
4. **Compare Jurisdictions** - AI can help identify differences
5. **Draft with Assistance** - AI accelerates writing process

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Never Trust Citations Blindly** - Recent sanctions for this
2. **Don't Skip Shepardizing** - AI can't tell you if cases are still good law
3. **Don't Ignore Ethics Rules** - Check your jurisdiction's rules on AI use
4. **Don't Forget Attribution** - Disclose AI use where required
5. **Don't Bypass Traditional Research** - AI complements, doesn't replace

## üîç Recommended Workflows

### Law Review Article Research

**Phase 1: Topic Development**
```
1. Use AI to explore potential topics
2. Identify major cases and statutes
3. Understand doctrinal debates
4. Develop research questions
```

**Phase 2: Traditional Research**
```
1. Use Westlaw/Lexis for comprehensive search
2. Shepardize key cases
3. Review law review articles (HeinOnline, Westlaw)
4. Check treatises and restatements
```

**Phase 3: Analysis & Writing**
```
1. Use AI to organize arguments
2. Draft sections with AI assistance
3. Use AI for editing and clarity
4. Verify all citations manually
```

### Case Analysis for Class

**Step 1:** Read the case yourself first
**Step 2:** Ask AI to identify key issues and holdings
**Step 3:** Compare your analysis with AI's
**Step 4:** Use AI to understand difficult concepts
**Step 5:** Verify any additional cases AI mentions

## üéì For Law Students

‚úÖ **Understand Material** - Use AI to clarify, not to avoid learning
‚úÖ **Check Academic Integrity Policies** - Schools have different rules
‚úÖ **Disclose When Required** - Some assignments may require disclosure
‚úÖ **Practice Real Skills** - Don't let AI do all the work

### Bar Exam Preparation

- AI can explain complex concepts
- Use for practice hypo analysis
- Get feedback on essay organization
