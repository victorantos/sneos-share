    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s speculate on some of the most anticipated games for 2025, keeping in mind that release dates are always subject to change!  This is a mix of announced titles, strong rumors, and reasonable expectations based on development cycles.\n\n**General Expectations for 2025 Gaming:**\n\n*   **Continued Emphasis on Cross-Platform:** Expect more games with cross-play and cross-progression features.\n*   **Next-Gen Optimization:** Developers will be more comfortable maximizing the power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, leading to even more visually stunning and technically impressive games.\n*   **AI Advancements:** We\u0027ll likely see further integration of AI for smarter enemies, more dynamic worlds, and possibly even more personalized gameplay experiences.\n*   **Cloud Gaming:**  Cloud gaming services will continue to grow and potentially offer more compelling options.\n*   **VR Maturation:** While VR might not be fully mainstream, we\u0027ll likely see some significant VR releases.\n\n**Here\u0027s a breakdown by platform and genre, with a mix of confirmed and highly anticipated titles:**\n\n**PlayStation 5**\n\n*   **Marvel\u0027s Spider-Man 3 (Likely):**  Insomniac has set a high bar.
