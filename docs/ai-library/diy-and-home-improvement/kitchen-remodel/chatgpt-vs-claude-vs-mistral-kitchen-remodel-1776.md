Here are some budget-friendly ideas:\n\n1. **Paint or Refinish Cabinets**: Instead of replacing cabinets, consider painting or refinishing them. This can dramatically change the look of your kitchen at a fraction of the cost.\n\n2. **Update Hardware**: Replacing cabinet handles and drawer pulls can give your kitchen a fresh look. Choose hardware that complements your new cabinet color or finish.\n\n3. **Install a New Backsplash**: A colorful tile or peel-and-stick backsplash can add a pop of color and style to your kitchen.

Alternatively, consider installing butcher block or laminate countertops, which are more affordable than stone or quartz.\n\n7. **Add Open Shelving**: Remove some cabinet doors to create open shelving. This can make your kitchen feel more spacious and is a great way to display attractive dishware.\n\n8. **Update the Sink and Faucet**: A new sink and faucet can make a big difference in the look and functionality of your kitchen. Choose a stylish, affordable option that fits your budget.\n\n9. **DIY Island**: If you have space, consider building a DIY kitchen island.
