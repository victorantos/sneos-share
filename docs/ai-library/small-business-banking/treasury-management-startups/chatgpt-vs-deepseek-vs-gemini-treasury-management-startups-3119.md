These companies are challenging traditional banks by using technology to offer more transparent, efficient, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and individuals dealing with international payments.\n\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive breakdown of the FX management startup ecosystem:\n\n### Core Value Propositions (Why They Exist)\n\nTraditional banks often have:\n* **High, hidden fees** (built into poor exchange rates)\n* **Slow transaction times** (3-5 business days)\n* **Opaque pricing structures**\n* **Cumbersome processes** for businesses\n\nFX startups solve these problems with:\n* **Transparency:** Real-time, mid-market exchange rates with a small, upfront margin.\n* **Lower Costs:** Significantly lower fees than banks, often 0.3%-0.7% versus 3-5%.\n* **Speed \u0026 Efficiency:** Faster payments, sometimes same-day, using modern tech stacks.\n* **User Experience:** Intuitive online platforms and APIs.\n* **Advanced Tools:** Hedging, multi-currency accounts, and automated payments.\n\n---\n\n### Key Categories of FX Management Startups\n\n#### 1.
