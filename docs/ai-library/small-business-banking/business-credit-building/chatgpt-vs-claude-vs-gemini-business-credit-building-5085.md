Each bureau has its own scoring model. Examples include D\u0026B\u0027s PAYDEX Score and Experian\u0027s Intelliscore Plus.\n*   **Payment History:** Records of how promptly the business pays its bills to suppliers and other creditors.  This includes the number of on-time payments, late payments, and the average number of days late (Days Beyond Terms or DBT).\n*   **Credit Utilization:** The amount of credit a business is using compared to its available credit limits.\n*   **Public Records:**  Information from public sources such as bankruptcies, liens, judgments, and UCC filings (Uniform Commercial Code).\n*   **Financial Information:** (If available) Balance sheets, income statements, and other financial data.

Understanding how these agencies operate and how to build good business credit is crucial for long-term financial success.**\n"
