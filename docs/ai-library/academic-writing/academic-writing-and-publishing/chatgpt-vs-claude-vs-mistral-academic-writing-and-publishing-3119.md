  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Using inclusive and anti-oppressive language involves being sensitive to the preferences and identities of individuals and communities. Here\u0027s a brief guide to help you choose between person-first and identity-first language:\n\n1. **Person-First Language**: This approach emphasizes the individual before their identity or condition. It is often preferred in contexts where the condition should not define the person, such as in many disability communities.\n   - Example: \u0022A person with autism\u0022 instead of \u0022an autistic person.\u0022\n\n2. **Identity-First Language**: Some communities prefer this approach, as they view the identity as an integral part of who they are. This is often embraced by some individuals within the disability community and the LGBTQ\u002B community.\n   - Example: \u0022An autistic person\u0022 instead of \u0022a person with autism.\u0022\n\n### How to Decide\n\n- **Research and Context**: Always consider the specific community or individual\u0027s preference. Some groups have established norms around language usage. \n- **Ask**: When possible, ask individuals how they prefer to be referred to, as personal preferences can vary widely.\n- **Stay Updated**: Language and preferences can evolve over time, so staying informed is essential.\n\n### Examples of Using Person-First and Identity-First Language:\n\n- **Disability**:\n  - Person-First: \u0022A person with a disability\u0022\n  - Identity-First: \u0022A disabled person\u0022\n\n- **Autism**:\n  - Person-First: \u0022A person with autism\u0022\n  - Identity-First: \u0022An autistic person\u0022\n\n- **LGBTQIA\u002B Community**:\n  - Person-First: \u0022A person who identifies as queer\u0022\n  - Identity-First: \u0022A queer person\u0022\n\n### General Tips for Writing Inclusively:\n\n- Use gender-neutral terms when applicable (e.g., \u0022they/them\u0022 pronouns, \u0022partner\u0022 instead of \u0022husband/wife\u0022).\n- Be aware of cultural sensitivities and terminology, especially regarding racial, ethnic, and cultural identities.\n- Avoid stereotypes and generalizations; focus on individuals\u0027 unique experiences.\n- Use language that acknowledges people\u0027s lived experiences without reducing them to a single identity.\n\nBy being mindful of these guidelines, you\u0027ll promote inclusivity and respect in your writing.", "Claude": "# Guide to Person-First vs. Identity-First Language\n\n## General Principle\n**Ask individuals their preference when possible**, as this varies both between and within communities.\n\n## Common Community Preferences\n\n### **Identity-First Often Preferred:**\n- **Deaf community**: \u0022Deaf person\u0022 (capital D for cultural identity)\n- **Autistic community**: \u0022autistic person\u0022 (not \u0022person with autism\u0022)\n- **Blind community**: \u0022blind person\u0022 \n- **Disabled community**: Many prefer \u0022disabled person\u0022 (social model\u2014society disables them)\n\n### **Person-First Often Preferred:**\n- Many **intellectual/developmental disability** communities: \u0022person with an intellectual disability\u0022\n- Some **mental health** contexts: \u0022person with schizophrenia\u0022 (though this varies)\n\n### **Why Identity-First?**\nMany communities view their identity as integral to who they are\u2014not something separate or negative to distance from. It challenges the assumption that the condition is inherently bad.\n\n### **Why Person-First?**\nSome prefer emphasizing personhood first, especially to counter historical dehumanization.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Follow community consensus** when writing generally\n2. **Mirror individual preference** when writing about specific people\n3. **When unsure**: Listen to advocacy organizations led by those communities\n4. **Avoid outdated terms** regardless of structure (see separate guidance on ableist language)\n5. **Be consistent** within your document\n\n**Would you like guidance on other inclusive language topics?**", "Mistral": "Using inclusive and anti-oppressive language is crucial for fostering respect and understanding. Here are some guidelines to help you navigate person-first and identity-first language preferences:\n\n### Person-First Language\nPerson-first language emphasizes the person before their condition or characteristic. This approach is often preferred in contexts where the focus is on the individual rather than their condition.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Instead of \u0022a disabled person,\u0022 say \u0022a person with a disability.\u0022\n- Instead of \u0022an autistic child,\u0022 say \u0022a child with autism.\u0022\n- Instead of \u0022a diabetic,\u0022 say \u0022a person with diabetes.\u0022\n\n### Identity-First Language\nIdentity-first language places the identity or characteristic first, recognizing it as an integral part of the person\u0027s identity. This approach is often preferred by communities such as the autistic community and the Deaf community.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Instead of \u0022a person with autism,\u0022 say \u0022an autistic person.\u0022\n- Instead of \u0022a person who is deaf,\u0022 say \u0022a Deaf person.\u0022\n- Instead of \u0022a person with a mental illness,\u0022 say \u0022a mentally ill person\u0022 (if preferred by the individual).\n\n### General Guidelines\n1. **Ask for Preferences:** Whenever possible, ask individuals how they prefer to be referred to. Respect their preferences.\n2. **Context Matters:** Be aware of the context and the community you are addressing. Different communities have different preferences.\n3. **Be Consistent:** Once you know the preferred terminology, use it consistently.\n4. **Avoid Stereotypes:** Be mindful of language that reinforces stereotypes or stigmas.\n5. **Use Neutral Language:** When in doubt, use neutral language that focuses on the person rather than their condition or characteristic.\n\n### Examples in Practice\n1. **Person-First Language:**\n   - \u0022She is a person with a visual impairment.\u0022\n   - \u0022He is a person with a mental health condition.\u0022\n   - \u0022They are a person with a physical disability.\u0022\n\n2. **Identity-First Language:**\n   - \u0022She is a blind person.\u0022\n   - \u0022He is a mentally ill person.\u0022\n   - \u0022They are a disabled person.\u0022\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Avoid Ableist Language:** Be mindful of words that can be perceived as ableist, such as \u0022crazy,\u0022 \u0022lame,\u0022 or \u0022dumb.\u0022\n- **Use Gender-Inclusive Language:** Avoid using \u0022he\u0022 or \u0022she\u0022 when referring to a general group. Use \u0022they\u0022 or \u0022their\u0022 instead.\n- **Respect Pronouns:** Always use the pronouns that a person prefers, whether they are he/him, she/her, they/them, or others.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your language is inclusive and respectful, promoting a more equitable and understanding environment."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
