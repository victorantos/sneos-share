  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "To effectively craft a clear theoretical contribution or argument for your paper, consider the following structured approach. This will ensure that your argument is both coherent and compelling:\n\n### 1. **Identify the Research Gap**\n   - **What is Missing?** Begin by conducting a thorough literature review to pinpoint what existing theories or concepts fail to address. Clearly articulate these gaps.\n   - **Example Statement:** \u0022Despite extensive research on [Topic A], there has been insufficient examination of [specific aspect] which limits our understanding of [broader issue].\u0022\n\n### 2. **Articulate Your Theory or Argument**\n   - **Core Claim:** Concisely state your central theoretical contribution. This should be a specific claim or hypothesis that your paper will substantiate.\n   - **Example Statement:** \u0022This paper argues that [Your Theory/Concept] provides a more nuanced understanding of [Relevant Phenomenon], especially in context of [specific circumstances or variables].\u0022\n\n### 3. **Explain the Implications**\n   - **Why It Matters:** Elucidate the significance of your argument. Discuss how it advances existing theories, resolves the identified gaps, or implies new areas for research.\n   - **Example Statement:** \u0022By introducing [Your Theory/Concept], this paper not only fills a critical gap but also reshapes our understanding of [bigger picture] and offers novel pathways for future research.\u0022\n\n### 4. **Outline How You Will Support Your Argument**\n   - **Methodology Overview:** Briefly describe the methods or theoretical frameworks you will utilize to support your argument throughout the paper.\n   - **Example Statement:** \u0022Through a combination of [qualitative/quantitative methods, case studies, theoretical modeling, etc.], this work will provide empirical and conceptual evidence supporting [Your Theory/Concept].\u0022\n\n### Example of Stating the Theoretical Contribution:\n\n\u0022This paper proposes a new framework for understanding the interplay between individual motivation and collective behavior in social movements. While previous literature primarily examines them in isolation, we argue that [theoretical integration] can elucidate the dynamics that drive participation in movements. By addressing this gap, we not only enhance the theoretical discourse surrounding social movements but also offer practical insights for activists aiming to foster greater engagement.\u0022\n\nUsing this structure will allow you to clearly convey your theoretical contribution in a way that is both persuasive and academically rigorous. Feel free to modify the statements to better align with your specific topic and findings.", "Claude": "# Crafting Your Theoretical Contribution\n\nTo help you clearly state your theoretical contribution, I\u0027ll guide you through a structured approach:\n\n## 1) **The Core Statement Formula**\n\nA strong theoretical contribution should answer:\n\n**\u0022This paper argues that [core claim] by [theoretical mechanism/logic], which challenges/extends/integrates [existing theoretical perspective].\u0022**\n\n## Key Questions to Clarify Your Contribution:\n\n### **What type of theoretical contribution are you making?**\n\n- **Challenging** existing theory (pointing out contradictions, boundary conditions, or flaws)\n- **Extending** theory (applying it to new contexts, levels of analysis, or phenomena)\n- **Integrating** theories (bridging previously separate frameworks)\n- **Generating** new theory (proposing novel constructs, relationships, or mechanisms)\n- **Refining** theory (adding nuance, moderators, or mediators)\n\n### **What is the theoretical \u0022gap\u0022 you\u0027re addressing?**\n\n- What do existing theories fail to explain?\n- What assumptions need questioning?\n- What relationships remain undertheorized?\n\n### **What is your conceptual mechanism or logic?**\n\n- *Why* does your argument work theoretically?\n- What are the underlying causal processes or logical connections?\n\n---\n\n## Template for Writing Your Contribution Statement:\n\n\u003E \u0022Existing research on [topic] assumes/argues that [current view]. However, this perspective overlooks/cannot explain [limitation]. Drawing on [theoretical foundation], I argue that [your novel claim]. Specifically, I theorize that [mechanism/process], which has implications for understanding [phenomenon] because [theoretical reasoning].\u0022\n\n---\n\n**Would you like to share your topic/rough ideas so I can help you craft a specific statement?**", "Gemini": "This is a fantastic and crucial task for any theoretical/conceptual paper. A clear theoretical contribution is the heart of your work, demonstrating its originality and impact.\n\nLet\u0027s break down how to clearly state your theoretical contribution or argument.\n\n---\n\n## How to Clearly State Your Theoretical Contribution or Argument\n\nYour theoretical contribution is **what new understanding, framework, explanation, or critique your paper brings to your field that fundamentally changes how scholars think about a phenomenon, concept, or relationship.** It\u0027s not just a summary of existing literature, but a *leap* forward in knowledge.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Problem or Gap Your Paper Addresses\n\nBefore you can state your contribution, you need to articulate *why it\u0027s needed*. What is currently lacking, misunderstood, or incomplete in the existing literature?\n\n*   **What is the prevailing assumption or theory that you are challenging, refining, or extending?**\n*   **What important phenomenon or relationship is currently unexplained or poorly explained?**\n*   **What conceptual confusion or ambiguity exists that your paper seeks to clarify?**\n*   **What two (or more) disparate areas of research are you bringing together in a novel way?**\n*   **What are the limitations of existing frameworks in addressing a new or evolving context?**\n\n**Think:** \u0022The field currently understands X in this way, but this understanding is incomplete/flawed/limited because Y. My paper addresses Y.\u0022\n\n### 2. Articulate Your Unique Insight or Argument\n\nThis is the core of your contribution. What is the *new idea* you are introducing?\n\n*   **Are you proposing a new theory, model, or framework?** If so, what are its key components and how do they relate?\n*   **Are you refining, extending, or challenging an existing theory?** If so, what specific aspects are you changing, and why is your revision better?\n*   **Are you synthesizing disparate theories or concepts?** If so, what is the new lens or overarching perspective that emerges from this synthesis?\n*   **Are you offering a new explanation for an existing phenomenon?** What is the mechanism or logic you\u0027re introducing?\n*   **Are you introducing a new concept or re-conceptualizing an existing one?** How does this new understanding alter the field\u0027s perspective?\n*   **Are you developing a critical perspective on dominant theories or assumptions?** What are the hidden implications or biases you\u0027re exposing?\n\n**Think:** \u0022To address Y, I propose Z (my new theory/framework/argument). Z suggests that [core mechanism/relationship].\u0022\n\n### 3. Clearly State the \u0022How\u0022 and \u0022Why\u0022 of Your Contribution\n\nIt\u0027s not enough to say *what* you\u0027re doing; you need to explain *how* it contributes and *why* it\u0027s significant.\n\n*   **How does your contribution fill the identified gap or solve the problem?**\n*   **How does it differ from, improve upon, or challenge existing work?** What makes it *novel*?\n*   **What are the key mechanisms, assumptions, or relationships within your theory/argument?**\n*   **What are the implications for future research, practice, or understanding?**\n\n**Think:** \u0022Unlike existing approaches that focus on [X], my argument emphasizes [Y], thereby providing a more nuanced/comprehensive/critical understanding of [phenomenon]. This shift in perspective opens new avenues for research on [implication].\u0022\n\n---\n\n### Frameworks \u0026 Templates for Stating Your Contribution\n\nHere are some general templates you can adapt, moving from identifying the gap to stating your solution and its impact:\n\n**Template 1: Gap-Solution-Impact**\n\n\u003E \u0022Despite extensive research on [Topic A], the field has largely overlooked/struggled to explain [Gap/Problem B]. This paper addresses this oversight by developing a novel theoretical framework of [Your Theory/Framework C] which posits that [Core Argument/Mechanism D]. By doing so, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of [Phenomenon E] and provide a foundation for future research exploring [Implication F].\u0022\n\n**Template 2: Challenging/Refining Existing Theory**\n\n\u003E \u0022Prevailing theories of [Theory X] have long assumed [Assumption A] to explain [Phenomenon B]. However, this paper argues that [Assumption A] is incomplete/misleading because [Reason C]. We propose a refined/alternative theory of [Your Theory Y] that incorporates [New Element D], demonstrating how [Mechanism E] better accounts for [Phenomenon B], particularly in contexts of [Context F]. This theoretical refinement challenges the foundational premises of [Theory X] and opens new directions for empirical inquiry.\u0022\n\n**Template 3: Integrating Disparate Concepts**\n\n\u003E \u0022While the literatures on [Concept A] and [Concept B] have developed independently, this paper argues that a deeper understanding of [Phenomenon C] requires their integration. We theorize [Your Integrated Concept/Framework D] by drawing on insights from [Theory X] and [Theory Y] to show how [Mechanism E] links [Concept A] and [Concept B] in shaping [Phenomenon C]. This synthesis provides a new conceptual lens that enriches both literatures and offers a more holistic perspective on [Phenomenon C].\u0022\n\n**Template 4: Conceptual Clarification**\n\n\u003E \u0022The concept of [Concept X] is widely used in [Field Y], yet its precise meaning and underlying dimensions remain conceptually ambiguous/underspecified. This paper clarifies [Concept X] by distinguishing between [Dimension A] and [Dimension B], and theorizing their distinct antecedents and consequences for [Outcome Z]. Our conceptualization offers greater precision for researchers and practitioners, enabling more rigorous measurement and theoretical development within [Field Y].\u0022\n\n---\n\n### Key Elements of a Strong Contribution Statement:\n\n1.  **Specificity:** Avoid vague claims. Be precise about what you\u0027re contributing and how.\n2.  **Originality:** Clearly distinguish your work from existing literature. What\u0027s genuinely new?\n3.  **Relevance:** Explain why your contribution matters to your field and potentially beyond. What problem does it solve or insight does it offer?\n4.  **Clarity:** Use direct, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, or clearly define any new terms.\n5.  **Scope:** Briefly indicate the boundaries or applicability of your theory/argument.\n\n---\n\n### Where to Place Your Contribution Statement:\n\n*   **Abstract:** A concise, powerful version should be here.\n*   **Introduction (especially the last paragraph/section):** This is where you lay out your argument and its significance early on.\n*   **Literature Review/Theoretical Background (after identifying the gap):** Before presenting your own theory, reiterate the gap you\u0027re filling.\n*   **Discussion/Conclusion:** Reiterate your contribution, its implications, and future research directions.\n\n---\n\n### Example (Generic):\n\nLet\u0027s imagine a paper in organizational studies, focusing on \u0022employee engagement.\u0022\n\n**Initial Problem/Gap:** \u0022Existing theories of employee engagement primarily focus on individual psychological states, overlooking the dynamic, socially constructed nature of engagement in teams.\u0022\n\n**Unique Insight/Argument:** \u0022We propose a **relational theory of team engagement**, arguing that engagement is not merely an individual attribute but an emergent property of team interactions and shared meaning-making processes.\u0022\n\n**How/Why:** \u0022This theory posits that team engagement is cultivated through specific **collective sensemaking activities** (e.g., shared interpretation of tasks, emotional contagion, joint problem-solving) that foster **interdependent commitment** among team members. Unlike individual-centric models, our relational theory accounts for how engagement fluctuates and is co-created within team contexts, offering a more dynamic and ecologically valid understanding. This allows for new research avenues into how leaders can design and facilitate team interactions to build collective commitment, rather than solely focusing on individual incentives.\u0022\n\n**Combined Contribution Statement:**\n\n\u003E \u0022While prominent theories of employee engagement primarily conceptualize it as an individual psychological state, they fall short in explaining the dynamic, socially constructed nature of engagement within teams. This paper addresses this critical gap by developing a **relational theory of team engagement**, which posits that engagement is an emergent property cultivated through **collective sensemaking activities** and sustained by **interdependent commitment** among team members. By shifting the focus from individual cognitions to dynamic social processes, our theory offers a more ecologically valid and comprehensive understanding of how engagement is co-created in team settings, providing novel avenues for research on team design and leadership interventions aimed at fostering collective rather than merely individual commitment.\u0022\n\n---\n\nTo help me tailor this even more specifically, tell me a little bit about:\n\n1.  **Your general field or discipline (e.g., sociology, management, philosophy, education, political science).**\n2.  **The broad topic your paper addresses (e.g., leadership, climate change, identity, learning, power).**\n3.  **A very rough idea of the \u0022problem\u0022 or \u0022gap\u0022 you\u0027ve identified in the literature.**\n4.  **A preliminary thought on your \u0022solution\u0022 or \u0022new idea.\u0022**"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
