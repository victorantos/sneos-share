I was trained by Google.\n\n---\n\n### Now, let\u0027s help *you* write your author bio or biographical note!\n\nThis is a crucial piece of writing that can appear on book covers, websites, conference programs, article bylines, and more. It needs to be concise, informative, and engaging.\n\nTo give you the best help, I need a little more information from you. However, I can provide a comprehensive guide and templates you can adapt.\n\n### What is an Author Bio / Biographical Note?\n\nIt\u0027s a brief, third-person summary of your professional and sometimes personal life, designed to introduce you to an audience. Its purpose is to establish your credibility, give context to your work, and make you relatable.\n\n### Key Components to Consider:\n\n1.  **Your Name:** Always starts with your full name.\n2.  **Your Primary Identity/Role:** What are you first and foremost in this context? (e.g., \u0022Author,\u0022 \u0022Award-winning novelist,\u0022 \u0022Researcher,\u0022 \u0022Educator,\u0022 \u0022Consultant\u0022).\n3.  **What You Write/Create:** Your genre, subject matter, or expertise. (e.g., \u0022Speculative fiction,\u0022 \u0022Historical non-fiction,\u0022 \u0022Research on marine biology,\u0022 \u0022Plays for young audiences\u0022).\n4.  **Key Achievements/Publications:** Your most notable works, awards, significant projects. (e.g., \u0022Author of *The Silent Sea*,\u0022 \u0022Recipient of the Nebula Award,\u0022 \u0022Published in *Nature* and *The New York Times*\u0022).\n5.  **Relevant Background/Expertise:** Education, professional experience, or specific skills that bolster your authority. (e.g., \u0022Holds a Ph.D. in Astrophysics,\u0022 \u0022Former investigative journalist,\u0022 \u0022Over 15 years experience in sustainable development\u0022).\n6.  **Personal Touch (Optional but often good):** A brief, interesting detail about your life, hobbies, or where you live. This makes you more human. (e.g., \u0022Lives in Vermont with her two rescue dogs,\u0022 \u0022An avid hiker and amateur chef,\u0022 \u0022Finds inspiration in ancient mythology\u0022).\n7.  **Call to Action (If applicable):** Your website, social media handle, or next book.\n\n### Essential Questions to Ask Yourself Before Writing:\n\n*   **What is the purpose of this bio?** (e.g., back of a book, author website, academic journal, conference program, social media profile, literary magazine submission)\n*   **Who is your audience?** (e.g., potential readers, fellow academics, conference attendees, literary agents)\n*   **What is the required length?** (e.g., 1-2 sentences, 1 short paragraph, 2-3 paragraphs) This is *critical*.\n*   **What is the tone?** (e.g., formal, academic, witty, friendly, professional)\n*   **What is the single most important thing you want people to know about you?**\n\n### General Tips for Writing:\n\n*   **Third Person:** Always write your bio in the third person (e.g., \u0022She writes,\u0022 \u0022He lives,\u0022 \u0022Dr. Smith specializes\u0022).\n*   **Be Concise:** Every word should earn its place. Cut jargon where possible.\n*   **Start Strong:** Your first sentence should grab attention and establish your main identity.\n*   **Tailor It:** You might need different versions for different contexts. A bio for a sci-fi novel will differ from one for an academic paper.\n*   **Keywords:** Include relevant keywords for search engines if it\u0027s for an online platform.\n*   **Proofread Carefully:** Typos undermine credibility.\n\n### Structure Options \u0026 Examples:\n\nHere are templates and examples, ranging from short to more detailed.\n\n---\n\n**1.
