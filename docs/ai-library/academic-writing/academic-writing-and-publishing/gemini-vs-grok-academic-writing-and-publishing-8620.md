  :responses='{"Gemini": "Handling citations and references correctly is crucial for academic integrity and clarity. Since you\u0027ve specified **APA style (7th edition)**, let\u0027s break down how to implement it effectively.\n\nAPA style has two main components:\n1.  **In-Text Citations:** Brief mentions within the body of your text that direct the reader to the full source.\n2.  **Reference List:** A comprehensive, alphabetized list at the end of your document that provides full bibliographic information for every source cited in your text.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: APA In-Text Citations\n\nIn-text citations tell your reader where you got specific information. They typically include the author\u0027s last name and the year of publication. For direct quotes, you also need a page or paragraph number.\n\n### General Rules for In-Text Citations:\n\n*   **Author-Date System:** APA uses the author-date system.\n*   **Two Types:**\n    *   **Parenthetical Citation:** The author\u0027s last name and the year of publication appear in parentheses.\n    *   **Narrative Citation:** The author\u0027s last name appears in the running text, with the year in parentheses immediately following.\n\n### Examples of In-Text Citations:\n\n#### 1. Single Author:\n\n*   **Parenthetical:** (Smith, 2020)\n*   **Narrative:** Smith (2020) argued that...\n\n#### 2. Two Authors:\n\n*   **Parenthetical:** (Smith \u0026 Jones, 2019)\n*   **Narrative:** Smith and Jones (2019) found that...\n\n#### 3. Three or More Authors:\n\n*   **Parenthetical:** (Garcia et al., 2021)\n*   **Narrative:** Garcia et al. (2021) conducted a study where...\n    *   *Note:* Use \u0022et al.\u0022 (meaning \u0022and others\u0022) for the first and all subsequent citations.\n\n#### 4. No Author:\n\n*   Use the title (or a shortened version if long) and the year.\n*   **Parenthetical:** (*The Case for Climate Action*, 2022) or (\u0022New Trends in Education,\u0022 2022)\n*   **Narrative:** *The Case for Climate Action* (2022) suggested...\n\n#### 5. Corporate Author:\n\n*   If the organization is well-known, you can abbreviate its name in subsequent citations.\n*   **First Citation:** (American Psychological Association [APA], 2023)\n*   **Subsequent Citations:** (APA, 2023)\n\n#### 6. No Date:\n\n*   Use \u0022n.d.\u0022 (no date).\n*   **Parenthetical:** (Johnson, n.d.)\n*   **Narrative:** Johnson (n.d.) explained...\n\n#### 7. Direct Quotes:\n\n*   Always include the page number (p.) or paragraph number (para.) for direct quotes.\n*   **Parenthetical:** \u0022The results were inconclusive\u0022 (Brown, 2018, p. 45).\n*   **Narrative:** Brown (2018) stated, \u0022The results were inconclusive\u0022 (p. 45).\n*   **Block Quotes (40\u002B words):** Indent the entire block quote 0.5 inches from the left margin, double-space it, and omit quotation marks. The citation follows the punctuation.\n    \u003E Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. (Doe, 2017, p. 12)\n\n#### 8. Multiple Sources in One Citation:\n\n*   List them alphabetically by the first author\u0027s last name, separated by semicolons.\n*   (Lee, 2017; Miller, 2019; Williams, 2020)\n\n#### 9. Personal Communication (e.g., email, interview, phone call):\n\n*   Cite only in-text; *do not* include in the reference list.\n*   (J. K. Rowling, personal communication, October 26, 2023)\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: APA Reference List\n\nThe reference list provides the complete information for every source you cited in your paper. It allows readers to locate and retrieve the sources you used.\n\n### General Rules for the Reference List:\n\n1.  **Start on a New Page:** The reference list should begin on a new page after the main body of your paper, titled \u0022References\u0022 (centered, bolded at the top of the page).\n2.  **Alphabetical Order:** Entries are arranged alphabetically by the first author\u0027s last name. If no author, use the first significant word of the title.\n3.  **Double-Spaced:** All entries should be double-spaced.\n4.  **Hanging Indent:** The first line of each entry is flush with the left margin, and subsequent lines are indented 0.5 inches (a \u0022hanging indent\u0022).\n5.  **Include DOIs:** If a source has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), include it at the end of the reference. Format it as a hyperlink (e.g., \u0060https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxx\u0060).\n6.  **URLs:** For online sources without a DOI, include the URL. No \u0022Retrieved from\u0022 is needed unless a retrieval date is necessary (e.g., for content that might change frequently without an archive).\n\n### Common Reference Entry Types and Examples:\n\n#### 1. Book (Print or E-book without DOI):\n\n*   **Format:** Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work* (Edition, if applicable). Publisher.\n*   **Example:**\n    King, S. (2011). *11/22/63*. Scribner.\n\n#### 2. Edited Book or Chapter in an Edited Book:\n\n*   **Format (Whole Book):** Editor, E. E. (Ed.). (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.\n*   **Example (Whole Book):**\n    Jones, R.

They help you collect sources, generate in-text citations, and create a properly formatted reference list with a few clicks.\n2.  **Consult the Official Manual:** This guide provides common examples, but the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 7th Edition*, is the ultimate authority for specific or unusual cases.\n3.  **Use Purdue OWL:** The Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) is an excellent free resource with detailed explanations and examples for APA style: \u0060https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html\u0060\n4.  **Consistency is Key:** Make sure your formatting is consistent throughout your paper and reference list.\n5.  **Proofread Carefully:** Even with citation managers, errors can creep in. Double-check all author names, dates, titles, and formatting.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you\u0027ll be well on your way to properly citing and referencing your sources in APA style!", "Grok": "### Understanding APA Citation Style\n\nAPA (American Psychological Association) style is widely used in social sciences, education, and behavioral sciences for its emphasis on author-date citations and clear structure. The 7th edition is the current standard (as of 2023). I\u0027ll help you handle citations and references properly. If you\u0027re referring to a specific document or need examples for particular sources (e.g., books, articles, websites), provide more details for tailored advice.\n\n#### Key Principles of APA Citations\n- **In-Text Citations**: Use (Author, Year) for paraphrases or quotes. Include page numbers for direct quotes, e.g., (Smith, 2020, p. 45).\n  - One author: (Johnson, 2019)\n  - Two authors: (Lee \u0026 Patel, 2021)\n  - Three or more authors: (Kim et al., 2022) \u2013 use \u0022et al.\u0022 after the first author\u0027s name.\n  - No author: Use the title (shortened if long) and year, e.g., (\u0022Climate Change Report,\u0022 2023).\n  - No date: Use (Author, n.d.).\n- **Reference List**: At the end of your document, list all sources alphabetically by the first author\u0027s last name (or title if no author). Use hanging indents (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches).\n  - Double-space everything.\n  - Italicize book/journal titles; use sentence case for titles (only first word and proper nouns capitalized).\n  - DOI or URL: Include if available, e.g., https://doi.org/xxxx.\n\n#### Common Reference Examples\nHere are formats for frequently cited sources. Adjust based on your needs.\n\n1. **Journal Article (with DOI)**:\n   - In-text: (Nguyen, 2022)\n   - Reference: Nguyen, A. (2022). The impact of remote work on productivity. *Journal of Organizational Behavior, 43*(4), 567\u2013582. https://doi.org/10.1002/job.1234\n\n2. **Book**:\n   - In-text: (Brown, 2018)\n   - Reference: Brown, E. (2018). *Understanding cognitive development* (2nd ed.). Academic Press.\n\n3. **Website/Article on a Website**:\n   - In-text: (World Health Organization, 2023)\n   - Reference: World Health Organization. (2023, May 15). *Mental health in the workplace*. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-in-the-workplace\n\n4. **Edited Book Chapter**:\n   - In-text: (Garcia \u0026 Thompson, 2020)\n   - Reference: Garcia, M., \u0026 Thompson, R. (2020). Diversity in higher education. In L. Evans (Ed.), *Equity in academia* (pp. 100\u2013120). Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12345-6_5\n\n#### Tips for Proper Handling\n- **Avoid Plagiarism**: Always cite sources, even for ideas or data paraphrased in your own words.\n- **Tools**: Use free resources like Purdue OWL (owl.purdue.edu) for full guides, or software like Zotero or EndNote for automation.\n- **Common Errors**: Ensure DOIs are active links (no \u0022Retrieved from\u0022 unless it\u0027s a changing source like a wiki). For multiple works by the same author in the same year, add letters: (Smith, 2021a).\n- **Variations**: If your field has tweaks (e.g., APA for nursing), check the official APA Publication Manual (7th ed.).\n\nIf this addresses your query on APA for point 1, let me know what \u00222)\u0022 and beyond are, or share a sample text/source for specific formatting help!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
