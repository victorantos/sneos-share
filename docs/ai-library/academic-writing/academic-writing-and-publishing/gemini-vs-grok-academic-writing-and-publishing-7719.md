  :responses='{"Gemini": "Conducting a systematic search and documenting it thoroughly is the cornerstone of a high-quality literature review or meta-analysis. It ensures transparency, reproducibility, and minimizes bias.\n\nHere\u0027s a comprehensive guide:\n\n---\n\n## Guide to Conducting a Systematic Search and Documenting It\n\n### Phase 0: Preparation \u2013 Laying the Groundwork\n\nBefore you even touch a database, clear preparation is crucial.\n\n1.  **Define Your Research Question (PICO/PEO/SPIDER):**\n    *   **PICO (Quantitative/Intervention studies):** **P**opulation/Patient, **I**ntervention, **C**omparison, **O**utcome.\n    *   **PEO (Qualitative/Experience studies):** **P**opulation/Problem, **E**xposure, **O**utcome.\n    *   **SPIDER (Qualitative/Synthesis):** **S**ample, **P**henomenon of **I**nterest, **D**esign, **E**valuation, **R**esearch type.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** A well-defined question will guide your search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n    *   **Documentation:** State your precise research question clearly.\n\n2.  **Develop Clear Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:**\n    *   Based on your research question, establish upfront what types of studies you will include and exclude. Be specific.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Study Design:** (e.g., RCTs only, qualitative studies, systematic reviews)\n        *   **Population:** (e.g., adults aged 18-65, patients with type 2 diabetes)\n        *   **Intervention/Exposure:** (e.g., specific drug, mindfulness-based therapy, exposure to air pollution)\n        *   **Outcome:** (e.g., reduction in blood pressure, improved quality of life, experiences of caregivers)\n        *   **Language:** (e.g., English only)\n        *   **Publication Date:** (e.g., published between 2010-2023)\n        *   **Publication Type:** (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, dissertations, conference proceedings)\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** These criteria will be used during the screening process and must be consistently applied.\n    *   **Documentation:** List all inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly, with rationales if necessary.\n\n3.  **Create a Study Protocol (and Register it):**\n    *   A protocol outlines your entire methodology before you start. It should detail your research question, search strategy, selection process, data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis methods.\n    *   **Registration:** For systematic reviews and meta-analyses, consider registering your protocol with a public registry like **PROSPERO** (for health and social care topics) or Open Science Framework (OSF). This prevents duplication and reduces reporting bias.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Ensures transparency, reduces bias, and helps keep your project on track.\n    *   **Documentation:** Include a reference to your registered protocol (if applicable) and/or provide the full protocol as an appendix or supplementary material.\n\n### Phase 1: Developing the Search Strategy\n\nThis is an iterative process that requires careful thought and testing.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts/Keywords:**\n    *   Break down your research question into its core components (P, I, C, O, etc.).\n    *   For each component, brainstorm a comprehensive list of keywords.\n    *   **Consider:**\n        *   Synonyms (e.g., \u0022mindfulness,\u0022 \u0022meditation\u0022)\n        *   Related terms (e.g., \u0022anxiety,\u0022 \u0022stress,\u0022 \u0022depression\u0022)\n        *   Broader and narrower terms\n        *   American and British spellings (e.g., \u0022behavior,\u0022 \u0022behaviour\u0022)\n        *   Singular and plural forms (e.g., \u0022child,\u0022 \u0022children\u0022)\n        *   Acronyms and full names (e.g., \u0022PTSD,\u0022 \u0022Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\u0022)\n    *   **Documentation:** Create a table or list for each concept with all identified keywords.\n\n2.  **Utilize Controlled Vocabulary (Subject Headings):**\n    *   Databases use specific subject headings (controlled vocabulary) to categorize articles consistently, regardless of the author\u0027s chosen keywords.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **PubMed/MEDLINE:** Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n        *   **Embase:** Emtree\n        *   **CINAHL:** CINAHL Headings\n        *   **PsycINFO:** APA Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms\n    *   **How to find them:** Use the database\u0027s thesaurus or MeSH database (for PubMed/MEDLINE) to identify relevant subject headings. Look at highly relevant articles you\u0027ve found manually and see what subject headings they are tagged with.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Captures articles that might not use your chosen keywords in their title/abstract.\n    *   **Documentation:** List the controlled vocabulary terms used for each concept and which database they were applied to.\n\n3.  **Combine Terms with Boolean Operators:**\n    *   **AND:** Narrows your search; retrieves results containing *all* specified terms (e.g., \u0022mindfulness AND depression\u0022).\n    *   **OR:** Broadens your search; retrieves results containing *any* of the specified terms (e.g., \u0022mindfulness OR meditation\u0022). Use OR within a concept.\n    *   **NOT:** Excludes terms (use with caution, as it can inadvertently exclude relevant articles) (e.g., \u0022cancer NOT breast\u0022).\n    *   **Parentheses:** Use to group terms logically (e.g., \u0060(mindfulness OR meditation) AND (depression OR anxiety)\u0060).\n    *   **Documentation:** Show how you combined terms with Boolean operators in your full search strings.\n\n4.  **Employ Truncation, Wildcards, and Proximity Operators:**\n    *   **Truncation (\u0060*\u0060 or \u0060$\u0060)**: Finds variations of a word stem (e.g., \u0060depress*\u0060 finds depression, depressive, depressed).\n    *   **Wildcards (\u0060?\u0060 or \u0060#\u0060)**: Replaces a single character within a word (e.g., \u0060wom?n\u0060 finds woman, women).\n    *   **Proximity Operators (\u0060N\u0060ear or \u0060ADJ\u0060)**: Specifies how close terms should be to each other (e.g., \u0060mindfulness N3 therapy\u0060 finds mindfulness within 3 words of therapy). *Syntax varies by database.*\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Increases search sensitivity and captures more relevant articles.\n    *   **Documentation:** Specify which operators were used and their meaning if database-specific.\n\n5.  **Develop a Search String for at least One Major Database (Pilot Search):**\n    *   Start by building a detailed search string for one key database (e.g., PubMed or Embase), as it often has the most sophisticated controlled vocabulary.\n    *   **Test and Refine:** Run your pilot search.\n        *   **Too many results?** Add more specific terms, use AND, add limits, or refine subject headings.\n        *   **Too few results?** Add more synonyms, broader terms, use OR, or remove limits.\n        *   Review the titles and abstracts of the first few pages of results to see if they are relevant and if you\u0027re missing any obvious keywords or subject headings.\n    *   **Documentation:** Record each version of your pilot search string and the number of results, along with notes on what you changed and why.\n\n### Phase 2: Executing the Search\n\nOnce your core strategy is robust, you\u0027ll execute it across multiple platforms.\n\n1.  **Select Appropriate Databases:**\n    *   Choose databases relevant to your field and research question.\n    *   **General/Major Databases:** PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science (Core Collection), Scopus, Cochrane Library.\n    *   **Specialized Databases (Examples):**\n        *   **Health:** CINAHL (nursing), PsycINFO (psychology), LILACS, Global Health, SportDiscus.\n        *   **Social Sciences/Education:** ERIC, Sociological Abstracts, Education Source.\n        *   **Business:** Business Source Premier.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Maximizes coverage and ensures you don\u0027t miss key studies.\n    *   **Documentation:** List all databases searched and provide a rationale for their selection.\n\n2.  **Translate Search Strategy for Each Database:**\n    *   **Crucial Step:** You cannot simply copy-paste your search string from one database to another.\n    *   **Adapt Syntax:** Each database has unique syntax for subject headings, field codes (e.g., \u0060[tiab]\u0060 for title/abstract in PubMed, \u0060exp\u0060 for exploded MeSH), truncation, and proximity operators.\n    *   **Run Searches:** Execute your adapted search strategy in each chosen database.\n    *   **Apply Limits:** If appropriate, apply language, date, or study type limits within the database interface.\n    *   **Documentation:** **This is critical.** For each database, document the *exact, full search string* used, including all lines, limits, and the date the search was conducted.\n\n3.  **Save/Export Results:**\n    *   Export all search results from each database in a compatible format (e.g., RIS, CSV, plain text).\n    *   **Documentation:** Record the total number of hits for each database search.\n\n### Phase 3: Managing Results\n\nAfter collecting all your search results, you need to manage them efficiently.\n\n1.  **Import into a Reference Management Software:**\n    *   Use tools like **EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley, Covidence, Rayyan, or EPPI-Reviewer 4**.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** These tools help organize, deduplicate, and facilitate the screening process.\n    *   **Documentation:** Note which software you used.\n\n2.  **Deduplicate Records:**\n    *   After importing all results, use your reference manager\u0027s deduplication function (and/or manual review) to remove duplicate entries.\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Prevents repeated screening of the same article and inflates your numbers.\n    *   **Documentation:** Record the number of duplicates removed.\n\n### Phase 4: Expanding the Search (Beyond Databases)\n\nSystematic reviews often go beyond traditional database searches to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n1.  **Hand-searching Reference Lists:**\n    *   Examine the reference lists of included articles (and highly relevant systematic reviews/guidelines) for additional relevant studies.\n    *   **Documentation:** Document which key articles\u0027 reference lists were searched and any new studies identified.\n\n2.  **Citation Searching:**\n    *   Use tools like Web of Science or Scopus to identify articles that have cited your key included studies.\n    *   **Documentation:** Note if citation searching was performed and any results.\n\n3.  **Grey Literature Search:**\n    *   Search for unpublished or non-commercial literature. This helps reduce publication bias.\n    *   **Sources:**\n        *   Government reports, policy documents\n        *   Theses and dissertations (e.g., ProQuest Dissertations \u0026 Theses)\n        *   Conference proceedings (e.g., Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index)\n        *   Clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP)\n        *   Professional association websites\n        *   Specialized grey literature repositories (e.g., OpenGrey)\n    *   **Documentation:** List all grey literature sources searched and how they were searched (keywords, specific pages).\n\n4.  **Contacting Experts:**\n    *   Reach out to researchers in the field to inquire about ongoing or unpublished studies.\n    *   **Documentation:** Note if experts were contacted and any studies identified.\n\n### Phase 5: Comprehensive Documentation (The Reporting Phase)\n\nYour documentation should be so thorough that another researcher could replicate your exact search.\n\n1.  **Search Strategy Table/Appendix:**\n    *   **Present your full search strategy for EACH database.** This is typically done in an appendix or supplementary material.\n    *   **For each database, include:**\n        *   Database name\n        *   Date of search\n        *   **The complete, line-by-line search string**, showing all terms, Boolean operators, truncation, field codes, and any applied filters/limits.\n        *   Number of results retrieved.\n    *   **Example (simplified for PubMed):**\n        \u0060\u0060\u0060\n        Database: PubMed (via NCBI)\n        Date: YYYY-MM-DD\n\n        #1 \u0022mindfulness\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR mindfulness[tiab] OR \u0022mindful based intervention\u0022[tiab]\n        #2 \u0022Depression\u0022[MeSH Terms] OR depression[tiab] OR depressive[tiab] OR \u0022major depressive disorder\u0022[tiab]\n        #3 #1 AND #2\n        #4 #3 Filters: English, Humans, 2010-2023\n        \u0060\u0060\u0060\n        *(Actual search strings are often much longer and more complex).*\n\n2.  **Search Log/Record:**\n    *   Maintain a detailed log during the search process.\n    *   **Fields to include:**\n        *   Date of search\n        *   Database name\n        *   Search terms/strategy used (brief overview or link to full strategy)\n        *   Number of results found\n        *   Number of results exported\n        *   Notes (e.g., \u0022adjusted terms,\u0022 \u0022error occurred,\u0022 \u0022librarian consulted\u0022)\n\n3.  **PRISMA Flowchart:**\n    *   The **Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)** statement includes a flow diagram that visually represents the flow of information through the different phases of a systematic review.\n    *   **It documents:**\n        *   Number of records identified through database searching.\n        *   Number of additional records identified through other sources (e.g., grey literature, reference lists).\n        *   Number of duplicates removed.\n        *   Number of records screened (titles/abstracts).\n        *   Number of records excluded during title/abstract screening (with reasons if possible).\n        *   Number of full-text articles assessed for eligibility.\n        *   Number of full-text articles excluded (with detailed reasons).\n        *   Number of studies included in the qualitative synthesis (literature review).\n        *   Number of studies included in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).\n    *   **Why it\u0027s important:** Provides a clear, standardized overview of your search and selection process.\n    *   **Documentation:** Create and include the PRISMA flowchart in your article.\n\n4.  **Rationale for Database Selection:**\n    *   Explain why you chose specific databases for your review.\n\n5.  **Date Range and Language Limits:**\n    *   Clearly state any date limitations (e.g., \u0022studies published from January 2010 to December 2023\u0022) and language restrictions (e.g., \u0022English-language articles only\u0022).\n\n6.  **Software Used:**\n    *   List any software used for search management, deduplication, and screening (e.g., EndNote, Rayyan).\n\n7.  **Review Team:**\n    *   Mention how many reviewers were involved in the screening process (e.g., \u0022Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts\u0022).\n\n### Phase 6: Best Practices and Tips\n\n*   **Consult a Research Librarian:** Librarians are experts in search strategies and database specificities. They can save you immense time and improve the quality of your search.\n*   **Work in a Team:** Having at least two reviewers for screening reduces bias and errors.\n*   **Be Flexible and Iterative:** The search strategy isn\u0027t set in stone from day one. You\u0027ll likely refine it as you learn more about the literature.\n*   **Version Control:** Keep track of different versions of your search strategies.\n*   **Transparency is Key:** Your documentation should allow someone else to exactly replicate your search.\n\n---\n\nBy following these detailed steps for conducting and documenting your systematic search, you will build a strong, credible foundation for your literature review or meta-analysis. Good luck!", "Grok": "Below is a structured guide to conducting a systematic search for your literature review or meta-analysis. This process ensures transparency, reproducibility, and minimization of bias, which are essential for high-quality academic work (e.g., following PRISMA guidelines). I\u0027ll break it down step-by-step, focusing on the first part of your query: conducting the search and documenting it. If you have follow-up needs (e.g., screening, analysis), let me know.\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Research Question and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\n- **Why?** This focuses your search and helps document decisions.\n- **How to do it:**\n  - Use a framework like PICO (Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, Outcome) for clinical/meta-analytic reviews, or SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) for qualitative ones.\n  - Example: For a meta-analysis on exercise\u0027s effect on depression: P=Adults with depression; I=Structured exercise; C=No exercise; O=Symptom reduction.\n  - Pre-specify criteria: e.g., Include only peer-reviewed articles from 2010\u20132023, English language, RCTs only. Exclude gray literature if not relevant.\n- **Documentation:** Create a \u0022protocol\u0022 section in your review (or a separate PRISMA-P flow diagram). Note your question, criteria, and rationale in a log (e.g., Google Doc or EndNote table) with dates.\n\n### Step 2: Select Databases and Sources\n- **Why?** Comprehensive coverage reduces selection bias.\n- **How to do it:**\n  - Core databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (biomedical), Scopus or Web of Science (multidisciplinary), PsycINFO (psychology), Cochrane Library (systematic reviews).\n  - Add domain-specific ones: e.g., ERIC for education, EconLit for economics.\n  - Include gray literature sources: Google Scholar, theses via ProQuest, conference proceedings, or clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) to avoid publication bias.\n  - Aim for 3\u201310 sources based on scope; justify choices (e.g., \u0022PubMed for peer-reviewed health literature\u0022).\n- **Documentation:** List all databases, access dates, and search platforms (e.g., Ovid for PubMed). In your methods section, explain why you chose them and any limitations (e.g., \u0022Excluded non-English sources due to resource constraints\u0022).\n\n### Step 3: Develop and Run Search Strategies\n- **Why?** Keywords and Boolean logic ensure you capture relevant studies without overwhelming results.\n- **How to do it:**\n  - Identify keywords: Combine free-text terms (e.g., \u0022depression\u0022 OR \u0022major depressive disorder\u0022) with controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms in PubMed like \u0022Depressive Disorder\u0022).\n  - Use Boolean operators: AND (narrows), OR (broadens), NOT (excludes). Add truncation/wildcards (e.g., exercis* for exercise/exercising).\n  - Example strategy for the depression-exercise query:\n    - (\u0022depressi*\u0022 OR \u0022mental health\u0022) AND (\u0022exercise\u0022 OR \u0022physical activit*\u0022 OR \u0022aerobic\u0022) AND (\u0022randomized controlled trial\u0022 OR RCT).\n    - Adapt for each database (e.g., Emtree in Embase).\n  - Run searches iteratively: Pilot-test, refine based on hits (aim for 500\u20135,000 initial results).\n  - Date range: Specify (e.g., 2010\u2013present) unless historical context requires otherwise.\n  - Involve a librarian if possible for complex queries.\n- **Documentation:** \n  - Save full search strings/strings for each database (e.g., in an appendix table).\n  - Record hits per database, date run, and any modifications (e.g., \u0022Initial search yielded 1,200 hits; added synonym \u0027mood disorder\u0027 to capture 300 more\u0022).\n  - Use tools like Rayyan or Covidence for tracking.\n\n### Step 4: Export and Deduplicate Results\n- **Why?** Overlaps between databases inflate numbers.\n- **How to do it:**\n  - Export results to RIS/BibTeX format using database tools.\n  - Import into reference manager: EndNote, Zotero (free), or Mendeley.\n  - Deduplicate automatically, then manually verify (e.g., check titles/authors).\n- **Documentation:** Note total unique records post-deduplication (e.g., \u00222,500 duplicates removed from 8,000 total hits, yielding 5,500 unique records\u0022).\n\n### Step 5: Report the Search Process\n- **Why?** Allows replication and transparency.\n- **How to do it:** Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram:\n  - Diagram stages: Identification (total records from searches) \u2192 Screening (title/abstract exclusions) \u2192 Eligibility (full-text exclusions) \u2192 Included (final studies).\n  - For meta-analysis, also note effect sizes or data extracted later.\n- **Documentation Tips:**\n  - Methods section: Describe search exhaustively (e.g., \u0022Searches conducted on [date] using [strategy]\u0022).\n  - Appendix: Full search strings, hit counts, exclusion reasons (e.g., table with \u0022Reason: Duplicate\u0022 or \u0022Not RCT\u0022).\n  - Tools for visualization: PRISMA flow generator online (prisma-statement.org).\n  - Common pitfalls to document: Language biases, database access issues, or hand-searching journals (e.g., \u0022Manually searched top 5 journals for 2022 issues\u0022).\n\n### Additional Resources and Best Practices\n- **Guidelines:** Adhere to PRISMA 2020 (for reviews) or PRISMA-ScR (scoping reviews). Register your protocol on PROSPERO if it\u0027s a systematic review/meta-analysis (for health topics).\n- **Time estimate:** 10\u201320 hours for search setup and running, depending on scope.\n- **Tools:** Free: Zotero for management, Google Scholar alerts for updates. Paid: DistillerSR for full workflow.\n- **Ethical note:** Cite all sources properly (APA, Vancouver, etc.) and disclose funding/conflicts.\n- **Next steps beyond search:** Once documented, proceed to title/abstract screening (use two independent reviewers for reliability, kappa statistic for agreement).\n\nThis process will make your review robust and publishable. If you share your topic or a sample search string, I can help refine it!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
