  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "Of course! To provide the most relevant keywords, could you please share a brief summary or main topics of your manuscript? This will help me understand the subject matter and suggest appropriate keywords.", "Gemini": "That\u0027s a great goal! Choosing specific keywords is crucial for discoverability and ensuring your manuscript reaches the right audience.\n\nTo give you the best 4-6 specific keywords, I need a little more information about your manuscript. Please tell me about:\n\n1.  **Your Manuscript Title (or a working title):** Even a preliminary one helps set the context.\n2.  **A Brief Abstract or Summary (1-2 sentences):** What is the core topic and main finding/contribution?\n3.  **Your Primary Research Question(s):** What problem does your manuscript address?\n4.  **Key Methods Used:** (e.g., qualitative interviews, fMRI, statistical modeling, specific chemical analysis, historical document analysis, survey, meta-analysis)\n5.  **Main Findings or Conclusions:** What did you discover or argue?\n6.  **The Target Field/Discipline:** (e.g., developmental psychology, organic chemistry, economic history, software engineering, public health, literature studies)\n7.  **Any Specific Population, Context, or Geographic Area:** (e.g., adolescents in urban settings, specific type of cell, rural communities in Appalachia, 19th-century British literature)\n8.  **Any Specific Technology, Model, or Theory:** (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9, Diffusion of Innovations theory, machine learning, specific drug compound)\n\n---\n\n**In the meantime, here\u0027s a strategy to think about your keywords, aiming for specificity:**\n\nWhen selecting your 4-6 keywords, try to cover these aspects:\n\n1.  **The Core Subject/Discipline (narrowed):** Not just \u0022Psychology,\u0022 but \u0022Cognitive Psychology\u0022 or \u0022Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations.\u0022\n2.  **The Specific Focus/Novelty:** What makes *your* paper unique within that subject?\n3.  **The Methods or Approach:** Especially if they are distinctive or central to your findings.\n4.  **The Key Outcome or Phenomenon Studied:** What was the main thing you investigated or discovered?\n5.  **Specific Context/Population/Tool (if applicable):** If your research is specific to a certain group, region, or uses a particular novel tool.\n6.  **A Relevant Theory or Model (if central):** If you\u0027re testing or proposing a specific theoretical framework.\n\n**Avoid:** Too broad terms (e.g., \u0022Research,\u0022 \u0022Study,\u0022 \u0022Analysis,\u0022 \u0022Science,\u0022 \u0022Technology\u0022).\n\n**Example (Hypothetical):**\n*   **Manuscript:** \u0022Impact of mindfulness-based interventions on burnout in critical care nurses in urban hospitals.\u0022\n*   **Too broad keywords:** Nurses, Burnout, Mindfulness, Hospitals\n*   **Better, more specific keywords (4-6):**\n    1.  Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)\n    2.  Nurse Burnout\n    3.  Critical Care Nursing\n    4.  Intervention Study\n    5.  Healthcare Professionals\n    6.  Occupational Stress\n\n---\n\nOnce you provide some details, I can help you craft those 4-6 specific keywords for your manuscript!", "Grok": "It looks like your query got cut off\u2014I\u0027m happy to help brainstorm 4-6 specific keywords for your manuscript, but I need more details about the topic, genre, theme, or key elements (e.g., is it a sci-fi novel, academic paper on climate change, or memoir about urban life?). \n\nIf you share a brief summary or the main focus, I can suggest tailored keywords that are precise, searchable, and relevant. For now, here\u0027s a general example assuming a fictional historical drama:\n\n1. Victorian espionage  \n2. Industrial Revolution intrigue  \n3. Secret societies  \n4. London underworld  \n5. Female protagonist rebellion  \n6. Code-breaking mysteries  \n\nLet me know more to refine this!"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
