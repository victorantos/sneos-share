  :responses='{"ChatGPT": "**Structured Abstract**\n\n**Background/Objectives:** The incidence of mental health disorders among adolescents has risen dramatically over the past decade, prompting a need for effective interventions. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating anxiety and depression in this population.\n\n**Methods:** A comprehensive search was conducted across six electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) for studies published between January 2010 and August 2023 that examined the effect of CBT on anxiety and depression in adolescents. Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 12-18 years, a defined CBT intervention, and standardized assessment tools for outcomes. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analytic techniques, focusing on effect sizes and heterogeneity.\n\n**Results:** A total of 25 studies involving 2,400 adolescent participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate overall effect size (g = 0.65) for CBT in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms. Subgroup analyses indicated significant variations based on the type of CBT intervention and duration. Notably, internet-based CBT demonstrated similar effectiveness to traditional formats, expanding accessibility.\n\n**Conclusions:** This review underscores the effectiveness of CBT for treating anxiety and depression in adolescents, highlighting its potential as a first-line intervention. The evidence supports integrating CBT into clinical practice, particularly through digital platforms to enhance reach. Future research should explore long-term outcomes and the efficacy of adapted CBT protocols for diverse adolescent populations.\n\n**Keywords:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy, anxiety, depression, adolescents, systematic review, mental health interventions.", "Grok": "### Structured Abstract\n\n**Background/Objectives**  \nChronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 20-30% of adults worldwide, imposing substantial socioeconomic burdens. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and mindfulness, show promise but evidence on their comparative efficacy remains fragmented. This systematic review aimed to synthesize randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on non-drug therapies for CLBP, evaluating pain reduction, functional improvement, and long-term outcomes to guide clinical recommendations.\n\n**Methods**  \nWe conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to March 2023, using terms like \u0022low back pain,\u0022 \u0022exercise,\u0022 \u0022mindfulness,\u0022 and \u0022non-pharmacological.\u0022 No language restrictions applied. Inclusion criteria encompassed RCTs of adults with CLBP (duration \u003E3 months) comparing non-drug interventions to usual care or sham controls, with outcomes including pain intensity (VAS scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index). Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Meta-analysis employed random-effects models in RevMan 5.4, with heterogeneity via I\u00B2 statistic; GRADE assessed evidence certainty.\n\n**Results**  \nOf 1,856 records, 45 RCTs (n=5,128 participants) met criteria, primarily evaluating exercise (n=22), mindfulness-based interventions (n=12), and multimodal approaches (n=11). Exercise yielded moderate pain reductions (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.41; I\u00B2=62%) at 6 months, superior to usual care. Mindfulness showed small-to-moderate effects on disability (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.24; I\u00B2=45%). High heterogeneity arose from intervention variability; 60% of studies had low risk of bias. Adverse events were rare (2-5%).\n\n**Conclusions**  \nNon-pharmacological therapies, especially exercise, offer robust benefits for CLBP management, reducing reliance on opioids and enhancing quality of life. Future trials should prioritize standardization and diverse populations. These findings support integrating such interventions into primary care, potentially alleviating global healthcare costs.\n\n**Keywords**  \nLow back pain; non-pharmacological interventions; exercise therapy; mindfulness; systematic review; meta-analysis  \n\n(Word count: 248)"}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
