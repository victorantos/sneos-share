You should modify and expand the content according to your specific research focus, available resources, and any preliminary data you have collected. Good luck with your proposal!", "Gemini": "Okay, this is a comprehensive request! I\u0027ll help you structure an NIH R01 grant proposal for aging research, focusing on a specific, high-impact area: **Cellular Senescence and its dynamic Secretory Associated Senescence Phenotype (SASP) in driving age-related tissue dysfunction.**\n\nThis topic is highly relevant, mechanistic, and offers clear paths for innovation and translation, which NIH R01s highly value.\n\n---\n\n## NIH R01 Grant Proposal Outline: Investigating the Dynamic Evolution of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) as a Driver of Age-Related Tissue Dysfunction and a Target for Precision Intervention\n\n**Principal Investigator:** [Your Name/Proposed PI Name], Ph.D.\n**Institution:** [Your Institution]\n**Department:** [Your Department]\n\n---\n\n### **Specific Aims** (Page 1 of the application)\n\n**Overall Goal:** To fundamentally understand how the Secretory Associated Senescence Phenotype (SASP) dynamically evolves with age in specific tissue environments and to establish its causal role in driving age-related tissue dysfunction, thereby identifying novel, precision targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\n**Rationale:** Accumulation of senescent cells, characterized by their detrimental SASP, is a hallmark of aging. While senolytics (drugs that clear senescent cells) show promise, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of SASP, and its specific impact on distinct tissue stem cell niches and overall tissue function, remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that age-related changes in the tissue microenvironment sculpt a specific, detrimental SASP profile in senescent cells that critically impairs tissue-specific stem cell function and regeneration, and that precisely targeting these age-evolved SASP components can reverse age-related dysfunction.\n\n---\n\n**Specific Aim 1: To characterize the age-dependent evolution of the SASP profile in tissue-specific senescent cells and its impact on healthy neighboring cells.**\n*   **Objective 1.1:** Identify and quantify the specific repertoire of SASP factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, lipids, extracellular vesicles) secreted by primary senescent cells isolated from young versus aged tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, skin) using advanced multi-omics approaches (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, single-cell proteomics of secretome).\n*   **Objective 1.2:** Determine the functional consequences of age-evolved SASP profiles on critical neighboring cell types, particularly tissue-resident stem cells (e.g., muscle stem cells, epidermal stem cells), assessing their proliferation, differentiation, migratory capacity, and regenerative potential in vitro and ex vivo.\n\n---\n\n**Specific Aim 2: To establish the causal role of key age-evolved SASP components in mediating age-related tissue stem cell exhaustion and impaired tissue regeneration in vivo.**\n*   **Objective 2.1:** Utilize genetic (e.g., conditional knock-out/knock-in) and pharmacological approaches to manipulate the expression or activity of the most impactful, age-specific SASP factors (identified in Aim 1) in senescent cells within relevant tissue environments.\n*   **Objective 2.2:** Assess the impact of targeting these specific SASP components on tissue stem cell function, regenerative capacity (e.g., following injury models), and overall tissue health and function in naturally aged mouse models.\n\n---\n\n**Specific Aim 3: To investigate novel therapeutic strategies that precisely modulate the detrimental, age-evolved SASP to enhance healthy aging phenotypes.**\n*   **Objective 3.1:** Screen for small molecule inhibitors or biologics capable of selectively neutralizing or reducing the activity of the most detrimental, age-evolved SASP factors identified in Aims 1 and 2.\n*   **Objective 3.2:** Evaluate the efficacy of targeted SASP modulation (using identified inhibitors/biologics) in improving tissue regeneration, restoring tissue function, and extending healthspan in naturally aged mice, validating a precision anti-aging intervention strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Significance** (typically integrated into the Research Strategy, but often has a dedicated sub-section)\n\n**Problem Importance:**\nThe global population is aging rapidly, leading to an escalating burden of age-related diseases and a decline in quality of life. Understanding and combating the fundamental processes of aging is paramount to extend not just lifespan, but *healthspan* \u2013 the period of life spent in good health. Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest accompanied by a potent Secretory Associated Senescence Phenotype (SASP), is a recognized hallmark and key driver of biological aging. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with age, contributing to chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, and vulnerability to disease. Current therapeutic strategies, primarily senolytics, aim to clear senescent cells, showing promise but also facing challenges like broad-spectrum effects and potential unintended consequences of removing beneficial senescent cells. A more nuanced, precision medicine approach to aging is urgently needed.\n\n**Gap in Knowledge:**\nDespite significant advances, a critical gap remains in our understanding of:\n1.  **SASP Heterogeneity and Evolution:** How the specific composition of the SASP dynamically changes with age and tissue context. It is not a static entity; its profile likely evolves, becoming more detrimental with chronic aging stress.\n2.  **Specific SASP Drivers of Dysfunction:** Which precise SASP components are the key culprits driving specific age-related tissue dysfunctions (e.g., muscle weakness, skin fragility, impaired wound healing), as opposed to being bystanders or having beneficial roles.\n3.  **Precision Intervention:** The feasibility of therapeutically modulating *specific* detrimental SASP components rather than globally eliminating senescent cells, offering a potentially safer and more targeted strategy.\n\n**Innovation and Impact:**\nThis proposal directly addresses these gaps by employing cutting-edge multi-omics technologies and sophisticated in vivo models to decipher the complex, dynamic landscape of the age-evolved SASP. Our innovative approach moves beyond the \u0022one-size-fits-all\u0022 senolytic strategy by:\n*   **Unveiling SASP Dynamics:** Characterizing the *evolutionary changes* in SASP composition from young to aged states, revealing novel age-specific drivers of dysfunction.\n*   **Precision Targeting:** Identifying and functionally validating specific, detrimental SASP components, rather than entire senescent cells, as therapeutic targets. This represents a paradigm shift towards precision anti-aging interventions.\n*   **Translational Potential:** Laying the mechanistic groundwork for a new generation of \u0022seno-modulators\u0022 \u2013 drugs that selectively neutralize harmful SASP components, thereby restoring tissue homeostasis and enhancing healthspan, with potentially fewer side effects than current senolytics.\n\nThe successful completion of this research will provide a profound understanding of how senescent cell secretomes contribute to aging, offer novel biomarkers for age-related decline, and identify actionable targets for highly precise pharmacological interventions, ultimately improving the health and well-being of the aging population.\n\n---\n\n### **Research Approach**\n\n**A. General Design \u0026 Rationale:**\nOur research approach is a phased, integrative strategy combining descriptive multi-omics, mechanistic cell biology, and in vivo functional validation. We will utilize naturally aged mouse models, primary cell cultures, and genetic tools to dissect the complexity of the age-evolved SASP. The study design involves:\n1.  **Discovery (Aim 1):** Unbiased identification of age-dependent changes in SASP profiles.\n2.  **Mechanistic Dissection (Aim 1 \u0026 2):** Establishing functional consequences and causal links between specific SASP factors and tissue dysfunction.\n3.  **Translational Validation (Aim 3):** Testing the therapeutic potential of modulating identified detrimental SASP components.\nThis iterative approach ensures that our identified targets are both biologically relevant and therapeutically tractable.\n\n**B. Preliminary Data (Crucial for an R01 - *Example, you would replace with your own*):**\n*   **Evidence of Expertise:** Our lab has extensive experience in cellular senescence, aging biology, and tissue regeneration models (e.g., published papers using SA-\u03B2-gal staining, p16/p21 western blots, isolation of primary cells, functional assays like wound healing, grip strength).\n*   **Aim 1 Support:** We have generated preliminary RNA-seq data from primary fibroblasts and muscle satellite cells isolated from young (3-month) and aged (24-month) C57BL/6J mice, demonstrating differential expression of several known SASP components (e.g., IL-6, PAI-1, CXCL1, MMPs) and *novel, uncharacterized secreted factors* in aged cells. Our initial proteomics analysis of conditioned media (CM) from these cells further confirms significant age-related changes in the secretome, highlighting specific upregulated inflammatory cytokines and proteases.\n*   **Aim 1/2 Support:** We have shown that CM from aged/senescent fibroblasts significantly impairs the proliferation and differentiation of young muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vitro, compared to CM from young cells. This impairment is partially abrogated by pre-treatment of aged CM with a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory cocktail, suggesting the SASP is indeed detrimental.\n*   **Aim 2/3 Support:** We have identified a specific SASP factor (let\u0027s call it \u0022SASP-X\u0022 for this example) that is highly upregulated in our aged cell secretome. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock down SASP-X in primary aged senescent cells, we observe a partial rescue of young MuSC function when exposed to CM from these SASP-X-deficient senescent cells. This provides strong preliminary evidence for the causal role of specific SASP components and the potential for targeted modulation.\n\n**C. Detailed Methods \u0026 Analysis:**\n\n**Model Systems:**\n*   **In vivo:** Male C57BL/6J mice (young: 3-6 months, aged: 20-24 months) will be used.

Their cargo (miRNAs, proteins) will be analyzed via small RNA-seq and proteomics to identify EV-mediated SASP components.\n    *   **Spatial Proteomics/Transcriptomics (if applicable):** If available, technologies like GeoMx DSP or Visium will be applied to aged tissue sections to spatially resolve SASP factor expression near senescent foci.\n*   **Functional Impact on Neighboring Cells:**\n    *   **Co-culture \u0026 Conditioned Media Experiments:** Young MuSCs or epidermal stem cells will be co-cultured with senescent cells or treated with CM from senescent cells (young vs. aged).\n    *   **Assays:** Proliferation (EdU incorporation, cell counting), differentiation (e.g., myotube formation, keratinocyte differentiation markers), migration (wound healing scratch assays), and functional stem cell assays (e.g., sphere formation, colony-forming unit).\n\n**Aim 2: Causal Role of Age-Evolved SASP Components**\n*   **Genetic Manipulation:** CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (knock-out/knock-in) or shRNA/siRNA will be used to specifically reduce or enhance the expression of top candidate SASP factors identified in Aim 1 in senescent cells.\n*   **Pharmacological Manipulation:** Commercially available small molecule inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies against specific SASP factors will be employed.\n*   **In Vivo Models:**\n    *   **Direct Delivery:** Genetically modified senescent cells or localized delivery of SASP modulators (e.g., adeno-associated virus (AAV) for gene delivery, mini-pumps for drug delivery) into target tissues in aged mice.\n    *   **Systemic Treatment:** Aged mice will receive systemic administration of targeted SASP modulators.\n    *   **Functional Readouts:** Following injury (e.g., muscle crush, skin wound), regeneration will be assessed by histological analysis (e.g., fiber size, collagen deposition, immune cell infiltration), immunofluorescence for stem cell markers (Pax7, MyoD), and functional recovery (e.g., grip strength, wound closure rate).\n    *   **Tissue-Specific Senescence Burden:** SA-\u03B2-gal staining, p16/p21 IHC, and SASP factor expression (qPCR, ELISA) will be measured in treated vs. control aged tissues.\n\n**Aim 3: Therapeutic Modulation and Healthspan Enhancement**\n*   **Inhibitor/Biologic Screening:** Based on Aim 1/2 candidates, a targeted screen of existing small molecule libraries or development of neutralizing biologics (e.g., single-chain variable fragments, nanobodies) will be pursued to identify potent and specific SASP modulators.\n*   **In Vitro Validation:** Identified modulators will be validated in primary cell functional assays (Aim 1.2) to confirm their ability to rescue stem cell function.\n*   **In Vivo Therapeutic Trials:** Aged mice will be treated with optimized SASP modulators.\n    *   **Healthspan Parameters:** Body weight, activity levels, fur quality, cognitive function (if targeting brain), overall mobility, and disease incidence will be monitored longitudinally.\n    *   **Tissue Function Restoration:** Comprehensive assessment of targeted tissue function (e.g., muscle strength, skin elasticity, wound healing kinetics).\n    *   **Biomarkers:** Circulating SASP factors, inflammatory markers, and senescent cell burden in various tissues will be quantified.\n\n**D. Statistical Analysis:**\nData will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., Student\u0027s t-test, ANOVA with post-hoc tests, non-parametric tests). Power analyses will be performed to determine adequate sample sizes. Bioinformatics tools (e.g., DESeq2, GSEA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) will be used for omics data interpretation. All experiments will be performed with appropriate biological and technical replicates, and blinding will be implemented where appropriate to ensure rigor and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Timeline with Milestones (5-Year R01)**\n\n**Year 1: Discovery \u0026 Initial Characterization**\n*   **Months 1-3:** Establish primary cell cultures from young/aged mice, optimize senescence induction protocols.\n*   **Months 4-8:** Perform bulk and single-cell RNA-seq on young/aged senescent cells; initial proteomics of conditioned media.

This is a critical unexplored frontier.\n2.  **Multi-Omics for SASP Dissection:** Employing cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics and secretome proteomics provides an unprecedented, comprehensive view of the SASP at a granular level, moving beyond traditional cytokine arrays.\n3.  **Targeted SASP Modulation:** The shift from broad senescent cell clearance to *specific SASP component modulation* is a paradigm change. This approach promises greater therapeutic precision, potentially fewer side effects, and opens up entirely new classes of anti-aging interventions (\u0022seno-modulators\u0022).\n4.  **Mechanistic Dissection to Therapeutic Target:** Our rigorous approach directly links specific SASP components to functional age-related decline, providing a strong rationale for developing highly targeted therapies that address the root causes of age-related diseases.\n5.  **Translational Pathway:** The project is designed with a clear translational endpoint, aiming to identify therapeutic candidates that could be advanced towards preclinical development for improving human healthspan.\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\nThe successful completion of this R01 proposal will have a profound and broad impact on aging research and clinical translation:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Understanding:** It will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of how cellular senescence contributes to the aging process, particularly focusing on the dynamic and context-dependent nature of the SASP.\n2.  **Novel Therapeutic Targets:** It will identify novel and highly specific therapeutic targets for age-related tissue dysfunction and disease, moving beyond current broad-spectrum approaches.\n3.  **Precision Anti-Aging Medicine:** It will lay the groundwork for a new generation of precision anti-aging interventions (seno-modulators) that selectively neutralize detrimental SASP components, offering a more refined and potentially safer approach than existing senolytics.\n4.  **Biomarker Discovery:** The identified age-evolved SASP factors could serve as novel circulating biomarkers for biological age, disease risk, and treatment response in aging individuals.\n5.  **Improved Healthspan:** Ultimately, this research has the potential to translate into strategies that delay the onset of age-related diseases, maintain tissue function, and extend the healthy, productive years of life for the growing aging population.\n\n---\n\nThis framework provides a solid backbone for your R01 proposal. Remember to make sure your preliminary data directly supports each of your specific aims and demonstrates your team\u0027s expertise and capability to execute the proposed research. Good luck!", "Grok": "Below is a complete, fictional example of an NIH R01 grant proposal focused on aging research. This is structured to directly address your seven requests, drawing from standard NIH R01 guidelines (e.g., SF424 format, with Specific Aims, Significance, and Approach as key sections). I\u0027ve tailored it to a realistic topic in aging biology: investigating the role of senescent cell accumulation in age-related cognitive decline, using a mouse model of Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) with targeted senolytic interventions. This is interdisciplinary, blending gerontology, neuroscience, and pharmacology.\n\nTo make it feasible and demonstrable, I\u0027ve incorporated hypothetical preliminary data (e.g., from my \u0022lab\u0027s\u0022 prior studies). The proposal assumes a 5-year funding period with a budget request of ~$1.5M direct costs (standard for R01). In a real submission, you\u0027d customize with your actual data, collaborators, and environment.\n\n---\n\n# NIH R01 Grant Proposal: Senolytic Targeting of Senescent Cells to Mitigate Age-Related Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer\u0027s Disease Models\n\n**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Elena Rivera, PhD (Assistant Professor, Department of Aging Biology, University of Example State)  \n**Project Summary:** This proposal investigates how cellular senescence contributes to cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD), testing senolytic drugs to clear senescent cells and restore brain function. Our innovative approach combines single-cell transcriptomics, behavioral assays, and targeted interventions in aged AD mouse models to identify novel therapeutic windows. Successful outcomes could transform AD treatment by addressing root aging mechanisms, reducing the $300B\u002B annual U.S. economic burden of dementia.\n\n**Project Abstract** (250 words): Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, drives tissue dysfunction through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), exacerbating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. While senolytics (drugs that selectively kill senescent cells) show promise in peripheral aging models, their efficacy in the brain\u2014and optimal timing during aging\u2014remains untested. We hypothesize that intermittent senolytic treatment in mid-life clears hippocampal senescent cells, reducing SASP-mediated amyloid-beta (A\u03B2) pathology and preserving cognition in aged 3xTg-AD mice.  \n\n**Specific Aims:** We will (1) map senescent cell dynamics and SASP profiles in the aging hippocampus using single-cell RNA-seq; (2) evaluate the impact of timed senolytic dosing (dasatinib \u002B quercetin) on senescence burden, neuroinflammation, and AD pathology; and (3) assess long-term cognitive and synaptic outcomes in senolytic-treated mice. Innovation lies in our age-stratified, brain-region-specific approach, integrating multi-omics with in vivo imaging. Preliminary data from our lab show 40% reduction in senescent markers in young AD mice post-senolytic treatment, supporting feasibility. This work could pioneer senescence-based AD therapies, impacting 6M\u002B U.S. AD patients.\n\n**Budget Justification:** Direct costs: $275K/year personnel (PI 25%, postdoc, technician), $50K supplies (drugs, sequencing), $100K equipment (microscopy), $50K animal costs, $100K other (travel, stats). Total: $1.47M over 5 years. Human subjects: N/A (animal only).\n\n## 1. Specific Aims\nThe objectives are to elucidate the mechanistic role of senescent cells in AD progression and validate senolytics as a preventive strategy. We propose three integrated aims, each with clear, testable hypotheses and quantifiable outcomes.\n\n- **Aim 1: Characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of senescent cells and SASP in the aging hippocampus of AD mice.**  \n  *Objective:* Quantify senescent cell accumulation and SASP factor expression (e.g., IL-6, MMPs) across age stages to identify critical intervention windows.  \n  *Hypothesis:* Senescent astrocytes and microglia peak at mid-life (12-18 months), driving early A\u03B2 aggregation.  \n  *Approach:* Use 3xTg-AD mice at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months (n=10/group); perform senescence-associated \u03B2-galactosidase (SA-\u03B2-Gal) staining, p16^INK4a immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics) on hippocampal tissue. Expected outcomes: Identify 20-30% increase in senescent cells by mid-life, with SASP clusters correlating to AD pathology markers (e.g., r\u003E0.7 with A\u03B2 plaques).\n\n- **Aim 2: Test the efficacy of intermittent senolytic treatment on senescence clearance and AD pathology.**  \n  *Objective:* Determine if timed dasatinib \u002B quercetin (D\u002BQ) reduces senescent burden and mitigates neuroinflammation/A\u03B2 pathology.  \n  *Hypothesis:* Mid-life D\u002BQ dosing (3 cycles, months 12-15) clears 50% of senescent cells without toxicity, attenuating SASP and plaque load.  \n  *Approach:* Administer D\u002BQ (5 mg/kg dasatinib \u002B 50 mg/kg quercetin, oral) to 12-month 3xTg-AD mice (n=15/group, vehicle control); assess via flow cytometry for senescent markers, ELISA for SASP cytokines, and immunofluorescence for A\u03B2/tau. Expected outcomes: 40-60% reduction in p16^\u002B cells and 30% fewer plaques vs. controls.\n\n- **Aim 3: Evaluate long-term cognitive and synaptic rescue by senolytics in aged AD mice.**  \n  *Objective:* Link senescence clearance to functional improvements in learning/memory and synaptogenesis.  \n  *Hypothesis:* Senolytic-treated mice show preserved hippocampal neurogenesis and 25% better performance on cognitive tasks at 24 months.  \n  *Approach:* Conduct Morris water maze and novel object recognition on treated mice (n=15/group); measure synaptic proteins (e.g., PSD-95) via Western blot and in vivo two-photon imaging of dendritic spines. Expected outcomes: Significant (p\u003C0.05) cognitive gains and 20% spine density recovery.\n\nSuccess metrics: All aims achieve 80% power (\u03B1=0.05); integrated data will inform a senescence-AD atlas for future trials.\n\n## 2. Significance Section\n### Problem Importance\nAging is the primary risk factor for AD, affecting 6.7 million Americans over 65 and projected to triple by 2050, with annual costs exceeding $360 billion (Alzheimer\u0027s Association, 2023). AD pathology\u2014driven by A\u03B2 plaques, tau tangles, and neuroinflammation\u2014manifests decades before symptoms, underscoring the need for preventive strategies. Cellular senescence, where cells enter irreversible growth arrest and secrete pro-inflammatory SASP factors, is a core aging hallmark (L\u00F3pez-Ot\u00EDn et al., Cell 2013). In the brain, senescent glia amplify A\u03B2 toxicity and synaptic loss, yet no therapies target this mechanism. Current AD drugs (e.g., anti-A\u03B2 antibodies) offer modest benefits (10-20% slowdown) and high costs ($26K/year), failing to address upstream aging processes. Our work fills this gap by targeting senescence to prevent cognitive decline, potentially benefiting not just AD but related dementias impacting 10% of those over 65.\n\n### Innovation\nThis proposal innovates by (1) integrating age-stratified single-cell omics to map brain senescence dynamics, revealing intervention windows missed by bulk analyses; (2) using intermittent, low-dose senolytics optimized for CNS delivery (via liposomal formulation, per our prelim data); and (3) combining in vivo imaging with behavioral metrics for real-time functional readouts. Unlike prior studies focused on peripheral senescence (e.g., Kirkland et al., NEJM 2023), we pioneer hippocampal-specific targeting in AD models, potentially yielding a \u0022senescence clock\u0022 biomarker for clinical translation. Impact: If successful, this could shift AD paradigms from symptomatic relief to aging-rooted prevention, informing Phase I trials and reducing societal burden by 15-20% through delayed onset.\n\n## 3. Research Approach\n### Design\nThis is a mechanistic, preclinical study using the 3xTg-AD mouse model (Oddo et al., Neuron 2003), which recapitulates A\u03B2/tau pathology and cognitive deficits. Design is longitudinal and multi-modal: cross-sectional for Aim 1 (age cohorts); interventional for Aims 2-3 (randomized, blinded, vehicle vs. D\u002BQ groups, n=15/arm for 80% power via G*Power). Controls include wild-type littermates. All procedures follow IACUC guidelines; sex-balanced cohorts (50/50 male/female) address sex differences in AD (more severe in females).\n\n### Methods\n- **Animal Models and Interventions:** Breed 3xTg-AD mice in-house; intervene at 12 months with D\u002BQ (cycles: 3 days on/11 off, 3x). Dose based on human-equivalent pharmacokinetics (5-50 mg/kg, safe per FDA IND precedents).\n- **Molecular Assays:** Single-cell RNA-seq (Aim 1: isolate CD45\u002B glia via FACS, sequence 5K cells/sample); qPCR/ELISA for SASP (IL-6, CXCL8); histology (IHC for p16/SA-\u03B2-Gal, A\u03B2 with 6E10 antibody).\n- **Functional Assays:** Behavioral (water maze: 4 trials/day x 5 days, probe trial; object recognition: discrimination index \u003E0.6 = intact memory). Imaging: Two-photon microscopy (Aim 3: AAV-GCaMP6s for spine tracking pre/post-treatment).\n- **Data Integration:** Multi-omics via Seurat for clustering; path analysis (e.g., SASP-A\u03B2 correlations).\n\n### Analysis\nQuantitative: ANOVA/MANOVA for group differences (post-hoc Tukey, p\u003C0.05); survival analysis for longevity endpoints. Qualitative: UMAP for scRNA-seq visualization; machine learning (random forest) to predict senescence burden from SASP profiles. RNA-seq: DESeq2 for differential expression (FDR\u003C0.1). Blinded scoring for histology/behavior; inter-rater reliability \u003E0.8 ("}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
