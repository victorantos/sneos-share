  :responses='{"Gemini": "Okay, this is a comprehensive request, and writing a strong mixed-methods results section requires careful attention to detail, structure, and reporting standards.\n\nHere\u0027s a template and example content for a mixed-methods results section on student mental health, incorporating all your requirements. Remember to replace the placeholder data, themes, and quotes with your actual findings.\n\n---\n\n## Results Section: Student Mental Health Study\n\nThis section presents the findings from the convergent mixed-methods study on student mental health. Quantitative data are reported first, including descriptive statistics and inferential test results. This is followed by the presentation of qualitative themes derived from participant interviews. Finally, an integrated discussion connects the quantitative and qualitative findings to provide a more comprehensive understanding of student mental health experiences.\n\n---\n\n### Quantitative Findings\n\n**Participant Demographics**\n\nA total of 350 university students participated in the quantitative phase of the study. The sample comprised 210 female students (60.0%), 130 male students (37.1%), and 10 students identifying as non-binary or other (2.9%). The mean age of participants was 20.3 years (SD = 2.1), ranging from 18 to 28 years. Participants were drawn from various academic years: 95 (27.1%) first-year, 105 (30.0%) second-year, 80 (22.9%) third-year, and 70 (20.0%) fourth-year or above students.\n\n**Descriptive Statistics for Mental Health and Well-being Measures**\n\nDescriptive statistics for the primary mental health and well-being measures are presented in Table 1. On average, students reported moderate levels of generalized anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score of 12.5 (SD = 4.8), falling into the moderate anxiety range (8-14). Mean PHQ-9 scores indicated moderate depressive symptoms (M = 10.2, SD = 4.1), also within the moderate range (10-14). Perceived stress levels, as measured by the PSS, were similarly moderate (M = 25.0, SD = 6.2). Conversely, overall well-being scores (WHO-5) suggested relatively low levels of well-being (M = 13.0, SD = 4.5), which is below the threshold for good well-being (\u226513 points often indicates potential for depression screening). Perceived social support (MSPSS) was reported at a moderate level (M = 4.2, SD = 1.1) on a 7-point scale.\n\n**Table 1**\n*Descriptive Statistics for Mental Health and Well-being Measures (N = 350)*\n\n| Measure (Scale Range)               | *M*    | *SD*   | Skewness | Kurtosis |\n| :---------------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :------- | :------- |\n| GAD-7 (0-21)                        | 12.5   | 4.8    | 0.12     | -0.58    |\n| PHQ-9 (0-27)                        | 10.2   | 4.1    | 0.35     | -0.71    |\n| PSS (0-40)                          | 25.0   | 6.2    | -0.18    | -0.65    |\n| WHO-5 (0-25)                        | 13.0   | 4.5    | -0.42    | -0.30    |\n| MSPSS (1-7)                         | 4.2    | 1.1    | -0.05    | -0.87    |\n*Note*. GAD-7 = Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PSS = Perceived Stress Scale; WHO-5 = World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index; MSPSS = Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety, depression, stress, well-being, and perceived support, respectively, except for WHO-5 where lower scores can indicate poorer well-being.\n\n**Inferential Statistics**\n\n**Gender Differences in Mental Health Symptoms.** An independent samples *t*-test was conducted to compare GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores between female and male students. Female students reported significantly higher mean GAD-7 scores (*M* = 14.1, *SD* = 4.2) compared to male students (*M* = 10.8, *SD* = 3.9), *t*(348) = 6.25, *p* \u003C .001, *d* = 0.82. Similarly, female students reported significantly higher mean PHQ-9 scores (*M* = 11.5, *SD* = 3.8) than male students (*M* = 9.0, *SD* = 3.6), *t*(348) = 5.78, *p* \u003C .001, *d* = 0.76.\n\n**Correlations Between Perceived Social Support and Mental Health.** Pearson product-moment correlations were calculated to assess the relationships between perceived social support and mental health indicators. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with GAD-7 scores (*r* = -.41, *p* \u003C .001), PHQ-9 scores (*r* = -.45, *p* \u003C .001), and PSS scores (*r* = -.38, *p* \u003C .001). A positive correlation was observed between perceived social support and WHO-5 scores (*r* = .35, *p* \u003C .001). These correlations indicate that higher perceived social support was associated with lower anxiety, depression, and stress, and higher overall well-being.\n\n**Prediction of Anxiety Symptoms.** A standard multiple regression was performed to examine whether perceived stress, academic year, and perceived social support predicted GAD-7 scores. The overall model was statistically significant, *F*(3, 346) = 75.12, *p* \u003C .001, and accounted for 39% of the variance in GAD-7 scores (*R*\u00B2 = .39, adjusted *R*\u00B2 = .38). Perceived stress (\u03B2 = .48, *t* = 8.71, *p* \u003C .001) and perceived social support (\u03B2 = -.25, *t* = -4.55, *p* \u003C .001) were significant unique predictors of GAD-7 scores. Academic year (\u03B2 = .03, *t* = 0.58, *p* = .56) was not a significant predictor. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between perceived stress and GAD-7 scores.\n\n**Figure 1**\n*Scatter Plot of Perceived Stress Scale Scores and GAD-7 Scores with Regression Line*\n\n", "Mistral": "### Results\n\n#### Quantitative Results\n\n**Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThe study included 300 participants, with a mean age of 20.5 years (SD = 2.3). The sample consisted of 55% females and 45% males. The majority of participants were undergraduate students (85%), with the remaining 15% being graduate students.\n\n**Table 1: Demographic Characteristics of Participants**\n\n| Characteristic       | n   | %    |\n|----------------------|-----|------|\n| **Gender**           |     |      |\n| Male                 | 135 | 45.0 |\n| Female               | 165 | 55.0 |\n| **Education Level**  |     |      |\n| Undergraduate       | 255 | 85.0 |\n| Graduate             | 45  | 15.0 |\n| **Age**              |     |      |\n| Mean (SD)            | 20.5 (2.3) |\n\n**Inferential Tests**\n\nA series of t-tests and ANOVAs were conducted to examine differences in mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and stress) based on demographic variables.\n\n**Table 2: Mean Differences in Mental Health Outcomes by Gender**\n\n| Mental Health Outcome | Male (n=135) | Female (n=165) | t-value | p-value |\n|-----------------------|--------------|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Anxiety              | 12.5 (3.2)   | 14.3 (3.5)     | -3.85   | \u003C0.001  |\n| Depression           | 11.8 (3.1)   | 13.2 (3.4)     | -3.21   | 0.002   |\n| Stress               | 13.1 (3.0)   | 14.7 (3.3)     | -3.52   | \u003C0.001  |\n\n**Figure 1: Mean Scores of Mental Health Outcomes by Gender**\n\n![Figure 1](link_to_figure_1)\n\n**Table 3: Mean Differences in Mental Health Outcomes by Education Level**\n\n| Mental Health Outcome | Undergraduate (n=255) | Graduate (n=45) | t-value | p-value |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| Anxiety              | 13.5 (3.4)             | 13.8 (3.6)      | -0.54   | 0.590   |\n| Depression           | 12.6 (3.3)             | 12.9 (3.5)      | -0.51   | 0.610   |\n| Stress               | 14.0 (3.2)             | 14.2 (3.4)      | -0.38   | 0.705   |\n\n#### Qualitative Results\n\nThematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed three primary themes: academic pressure, social isolation, and coping strategies.\n\n**Theme 1: Academic Pressure**\n\nParticipants frequently mentioned the intense academic demands as a significant source of stress and anxiety.\n\n*Participant 103: \u0022The constant pressure to perform well in exams and assignments is overwhelming. It feels like there\u0027s no room for mistakes.\u0022*\n\n**Theme 2: Social Isolation**\n\nMany participants reported feeling isolated, particularly during periods of remote learning.\n\n*Participant 215: \u0022I miss the social interactions that come with in-person classes. It\u0027s hard to stay motivated when you\u0027re studying alone at home.\u0022*\n\n**Theme 3: Coping Strategies**\n\nParticipants described various coping mechanisms, including seeking support from friends and family, engaging in physical activities, and practicing mindfulness.\n\n*Participant 150: \u0022Talking to my friends and family helps a lot. Sometimes just knowing that someone is there for you makes a big difference.\u0022*\n\n#### Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative Findings\n\nThe quantitative results indicated significant gender differences in mental health outcomes, with females reporting higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. The qualitative findings provided deeper insights into these differences, highlighting the specific stressors and coping mechanisms experienced by students. For example, academic pressure was a common theme, which aligns with the higher stress levels reported in the quantitative data.\n\n**Figure 2: Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative Findings**\n\n![Figure 2](link_to_figure_2)\n\n#### Reporting Statistics\n\nAll statistical tests were conducted using SPSS version 27.0. Descriptive statistics were reported as means and standard deviations (SD). Inferential tests included independent samples t-tests and ANOVAs, with significance levels set at p \u003C 0.05.\n\n#### Objective Tone\n\nThe results section is presented in an objective manner, focusing on the data and findings without interpretation. The integration of quantitative and qualitative findings provides a comprehensive understanding of student mental health, highlighting key areas for further investigation and intervention."}' published-date="{DateTime.UtcNow:HH:mm}"
