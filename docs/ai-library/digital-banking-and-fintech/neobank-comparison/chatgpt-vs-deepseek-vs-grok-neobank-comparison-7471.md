It\u0027s common to use a digital bank *alongside* a traditional bank.\n* **Licensing \u0026 Insurance:** Ensure your money is safe. Check if the provider is a licensed bank (e.g., N26, Revolut in some regions) where deposits are insured, or if it\u0027s an e-money institution (e.g., Wise, Monese) where different safeguards apply.\n* **Customer Support:** Look for banks with robust customer support, preferably with options in your native language.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Start with **Wise** for transfers and multi-currency needs, and pair it with a primary spending account like **Revolut** or **N26**. If you are a new arrival in the UK, **Monese** is an excellent first step.", "Grok": "Many digital banks are popular among immigrants due to their accessibility, low fees, lack of physical branch requirements, and features tailored for international users.

Some neobanks partner with traditional banks to offer this (e.g., Chime partners with Bancorp Bank).\n- **Customer Support**: Immigrants may need assistance with unique issues (e.g., ID verification). Look for banks with strong, accessible support (chat, email, or phone).\n\n### Tips for Immigrants Using Digital Banks\n- **Start with Basic Accounts**: Use a no-fee digital bank to establish a financial footprint while gathering documents like an SSN or proof of address.\n- **Leverage International Features**: If you\u2019re supporting family abroad, use banks like Wise or Revolut for cost-effective remittances.\n- **Build Credit**: Some digital banks (like Chime) offer credit-building tools, which can help immigrants establish credit history.\n- **Check Visa Restrictions**: Certain visa types (e.g., tourist visas) may limit your ability to open accounts in some countries. Research the bank\u2019s policies or consult their support.\n\n### Conclusion\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., **Chime** and **Current** are excellent for basic banking without strict ID requirements, while **Revolut** and **Wise** are ideal for international needs. In Europe, **Monese** and **N26** cater well to immigrants and expats.

If you share your location or specific needs (e.g., remittance, business banking), I can narrow down the recommendations further!"}'
