Share content like \u201CJust Listed\u201D or \u201CJust Sold\u201D posts to highlight your activity in the area.\n- **Create Neighborhood-Specific Content:** Post videos or blogs about local schools, restaurants, parks, or housing trends. Use hashtags and geotags to attract local audiences.\n- **Yard Signs and Billboards:** Place signage with your branding in high-traffic areas or near your listings.

Clients expect fast communication in today\u2019s market.\n- **Go Above and Beyond:** Offer personalized touches, like welcome baskets for new homeowners or market updates for past clients.
