    "DeepSeek": "Of course! Comparing golf simulators on a budget is a fantastic way to bring the game home without breaking the bank. The \u0022budget\u0022 category has exploded with great options, but it\u0027s crucial to understand the trade-offs.\n\nHere is a comprehensive comparison of the best budget golf simulators, broken down by category.\n\n### Key Factors to Consider on a Budget\n\nBefore we dive in, understand what you\u0027re prioritizing:\n\n1.  **Accuracy vs. Entertainment:** Some systems are incredibly accurate for serious practice (Mevo\u002B), while others are more fun-focused for parties (OptiShot 2).\n2.  **Space Requirements:** You need enough room for your swing, the ball flight, and the projector/screen. Camera-based systems often need more space behind you.\n3.  **Hidden Costs:** The biggest budget-killer! The launch monitor is just one part. Remember to budget for:\n    *   **Net/Enclosure \u0026 Hitting Mat:** ($200 - $1,000\u002B)\n    *   **Projector:** ($300 - $800)\n    *   **Software/Game Licenses:** (Often a subscription or one-time fee)\n    *   **PC/Tablet:** To run the software.\n4.  **Indoor vs. Outdoor Use:** Radar-based systems (Mevo\u002B) work best outdoors or in very large indoor spaces. Camera-based (SkyTrak) and photometric (MLM2PRO) are better for standard garages.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison of Top Budget Golf Simulators\n\nI\u0027ve categorized them to help you find the best fit.\n\n#### Category 1: The \u0022Serious Practice\u0022 Starter Pack ($1,500 - $3,000)\n\nThese are for golfers who prioritize accurate ball data and realistic simulation.\n\n| Feature | **SkyTrak** | **FlightScope Mevo\u002B** | **Rapsodo MLM2PRO** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Price Range** | $2,000 - $2,200 | $2,000 - $2,200 | **$700** (Plus $199/yr subscription) |\n| **Technology** | Photometric (High-Speed Camera) | Doppler Radar | Dual Optical Cameras \u0026 Radar |\n| **Key Data** | Ball Data: Speed, Launch, Spin, Carry.
