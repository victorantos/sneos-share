    "DeepSeek": "Of course! \u0022Rounding up\u0022 your spare change to invest is a popular and easy way to get started. Here\u2019s a comprehensive roundup of the best investing apps that offer this feature, along with key details to help you choose.\n\n### What is \u0022Round-Up\u0022 Investing?\n\nThis feature automatically rounds up your everyday debit card purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the \u0022spare change.\u0022 For example, if you buy a coffee for $3.75, the app rounds up to $4.00 and invests the $0.25 difference.\n\n---\n\n### Top Round-Up Investing Apps at a Glance\n\n| App | Best For | Round-Up Feature | Fees (Basic Tier) | Investment Options | Key Feature |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Acorns** | **The Set-and-Forget Beginner** | **Core Feature** | $3/mo (Personal) or $5/mo (Family) | Pre-built ETF Portfolios | All-in-one: Invest, Retirement (Acorns Later), Banking (Acorns Checking) |\n| **Stash** | **Learning \u0026 Choosing Your Investments** | **Available** | $3/mo (Growth) or $9/mo (Stash\u002B) | Individual Stocks \u0026 ETFs | Educational focus, fractional shares, \u0022Stock-Back\u0022\u00AE Debit Card |\n| **Chime\u00AE** | **Investing \u002B Banking Combo** | **Available** | $0 | Single S\u0026P 500 ETF | Integrated with Chime\u0027s popular banking app (checking \u0026 savings) |\n| **Qapital** | **Goal-Based Saving \u0026 Investing** | **Core Feature** | $3/mon (Basic) or $6/mon (Complete) | Pre-built ETF Portfolios | Strong rules-based saving features alongside investing |\n| **M1 Finance** | **The DIY Investor** | **Available** | $0 (Basic) or $3.99/mo (M1 Plus) | Custom \u0022Pies\u0022 of Stocks/ETFs | Sophisticated tools, borrowing, one-click rebalancing |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown of Each App\n\n#### 1. Acorns: The Pioneer\nAcorns is the original round-up app and is designed for absolute simplicity.\n\n*   **How it Works:** Links your debit/credit cards, rounds up transactions, and invests the spare change into a pre-built, diversified ETF portfolio based on your risk tolerance.\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Extremely hands-off and easy to use.\n    * *All-in-one ecosystem* with checking account, retirement account (IRA), and debit card.\n    * \u0022Found Money\u0022 partners give you bonus investments when you shop at brands like Apple, Walmart, and Airbnb.\n*   **Cons:**\n    * The $3/month fee can be high for very small account balances.\n    * You have very little control over the individual stocks/ETFs in your portfolio.\n*   **Verdict:** Perfect for someone who wants to start investing without having to think about it.\n\n#### 2. Stash: Learn and Invest\nStash focuses on education and giving you more choice over what you invest in.\n\n*   **How it Works:** Round-ups are one of several ways to fund your account. You then invest the money into a selection of ETFs and fractional shares of individual stocks that *you* choose.\n*   **Pros:**\n    * Educational content helps you learn about investing.\n    * \u0022Stock-Back\u0022\u00AE Card: Earn stock in the companies you shop with (e.g., buy gas and get stock in ExxonMobil).\n    * More control and personalization than Acorns.\n*   **Cons:**\n    * The monthly fee can also eat into small balances.\n    * Requires a bit more engagement and decision-making.\n*   **Verdict:** Ideal for beginners who want to learn and have a say in their investments.\n\n#### 3. Chime: Banking First, Investing Second\nChime is primarily a free mobile banking app that has added a round-up investing feature.\n\n*   **How it Works:** When you use your Chime Visa\u00AE Debit Card, you can opt to round up and invest the change. The money is invested in a single, low-cost ETF that tracks the S\u0026P 500.\n*   **Pros:**\n    * **No monthly fees.**\n    * Seamlessly integrated with your checking and savings accounts.\n    * Super simple\u2014only one investment option.\n*   **Cons:**\n    * Not diversified; your entire investment is in one S\u0026P 500 ETF.\n    * Limited features compared to dedicated investment apps.\n*   **Verdict:** A great, simple add-on if you are already a Chime banking customer.\n\n#### 4. Qapital: For Savers with Goals\nQapital started as a savings app with powerful automation rules and has since added investing.\n\n*   **How it Works:** You set a financial goal (e.g., \u0022New Car\u0022), and round-ups (along with other rules) automatically fund it. You can then choose to invest those savings into a portfolio.\n*   **Pros:**\n    * Excellent goal-setting and behavioral tools (e.g., round-up multipliers, spending limits).\n    * Helps you tie your investing to a specific purpose.\n*   **Cons:**\n    * The investing feature is secondary to the saving functionality.\n    * Another app with a monthly fee.\n*   **Verdict:** Best for people who are motivated by goals and want to use round-ups for both saving and investing.\n\n#### 5. M1 Finance: The Power User\u0027s Choice\nM1 Finance is a full-featured brokerage that happens to have a round-up feature.\n\n*   **How it Works:** You create a custom portfolio \u0022Pie\u0022 made of up to 500 stocks and ETFs. You can then enable \u0022Round-Ups\u0022 to automatically invest your spare change into your custom Pie.\n*   **Pros:**\n    * **$0 trading fees** on the basic tier.\n    * Maximum control and customization over your portfolio.\n    * Advanced features like borrowing against your portfolio (margin).\n*   **Cons:**\n    * Can be overwhelming for a complete beginner.\n    * Round-ups are not the main focus of the app.\n*   **Verdict:** The best choice if you are a confident DIY investor who wants round-ups as a secondary, automated funding method for your sophisticated portfolio.\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations Before You Choose\n\n1.  **Fees:** The monthly fees on apps like Acorns and Stash can represent a significant percentage of your investment if your balance is low (e.g., a $3 fee on a $100 balance is a 3% annual fee). Make sure the value justifies the cost.\n2.  **Investment Control:** Do you want a hands-off, managed portfolio (Acorns) or do you want to pick your own stocks (Stash, M1)?\n3.  **Your Primary Goal:** Is your main goal just to invest spare change (Acorns), or is it to learn (Stash), or to manage your entire financial life (M1, Chime)?\n4.  **Account Minimums:** Most of these apps have $0 minimums to start, making them very accessible.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n*   **For the Absolute Beginner:** Start with **Acorns**. It\u2019s the simplest and most automated.\n*   **For the Curious Beginner:** Go with **Stash**. You\u0027ll get the automation of round-ups plus the education and choice to grow your knowledge.\n*   **For the DIY Investor:** Use **M1 Finance**. You get a powerful, free brokerage account with round-ups as a nice bonus feature.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down \u0022round-up investing apps.\u0022  These apps, sometimes called \u0022acorn apps\u0022 or \u0022spare change apps,\u0022 are designed to make investing easier and more accessible, especially for beginners.  Here\u0027s a general overview and some popular examples:\n\n**How Round-Up Investing Works (The Basics):**\n\n1.  **Linking Accounts:** You connect the app to your checking account and/or credit cards.\n\n2.  **Tracking Purchases:**  The app monitors your transactions.\n\n3.  **Rounding Up:** For each purchase, the app rounds the amount up to the next whole dollar.  For example, if you buy a coffee for $2.50, the app \u0022rounds up\u0022 to $3.00.\n\n4.  **Investing the Difference:** The \u0022spare change\u0022 (in the above example, $0.50) is accumulated.  Once the accumulated amount reaches a certain threshold (usually $5 or $10), the app automatically transfers that money from your linked checking account to your investment account.\n\n5.  **Portfolio Selection:** You typically choose a portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. The app then invests your money in a diversified portfolio of ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) or sometimes individual stocks.\n\n**Key Advantages of Round-Up Investing Apps:**\n\n*   **Accessibility:** Low minimum investments and the ability to invest small amounts make it easy to get started, even with limited funds.\n*   **Automation:** The automatic round-ups and investing make it a \u0022set it and forget it\u0022 approach to saving and investing.\n*   **Behavioral Change:** It subtly encourages saving by turning everyday spending into investment opportunities.\n*   **Diversification:** They typically invest in ETFs, providing instant diversification across a range of assets.\n*   **Educational:** Some apps offer educational resources to help users learn more about investing.\n\n**Potential Drawbacks:**\n\n*   **Fees:** Most round-up apps charge fees, either a flat monthly fee or a percentage of assets under management.  It\u0027s crucial to understand the fee structure and whether it\u0027s worth it for your investment amount.\n*   **Limited Investment Options:** Investment choices are usually limited to pre-selected portfolios.\n*   **Slow Growth (Initially):** The initial investment amounts are small, so growth can be slow in the beginning.\n*   **Potential for Overdrafts:** If you don\u0027t have enough money in your checking account, the round-up transfers could trigger overdraft fees.\n\n**Popular Round-Up Investing Apps (with key features):**\n\n*   **Acorns:** *Widely known, often considered the original.*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Round-ups, recurring investments, a debit card with bonus investments at partner retailers (\u0022Found Money\u0022), retirement accounts (Acorns Later), and checking account services.\n    *   **Pricing:**  Subscription-based: Acorns Personal ($3/month), Acorns Premium ($9/month).  Each tier offers different features.\n    *   **Investments:**  ETFs based on risk tolerance.\n\n*   **Stash:** *Offers both round-up investing and the ability to choose individual stocks.*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Round-ups, individual stock investing, banking services, custodial accounts for kids.\n    *   **Pricing:** Subscription-based: Stash Growth ($3/month), Stash\u002B ($9/month).\n    *   **Investments:** ETFs, individual stocks.\n\n*   **Robinhood:** *Popular for commission-free trading, also offers round-ups (though it\u0027s a smaller part of their platform).*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, and options; Round-ups on debit card purchases; Cash management features.\n    *   **Pricing:** No commission for trading stocks and ETFs. Robinhood Gold is an optional premium service with margin investing and other perks (additional monthly fee).\n    *   **Investments:** Stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrency.\n\n*   **Webull:** *Similar to Robinhood, focuses on active trading but also offers a round-up feature.*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, and options; fractional shares; paper trading; round-up investments.\n    *   **Pricing:** No commission for trading stocks and ETFs.  Webull offers a premium subscription with more advanced features.\n    *   **Investments:** Stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrency.\n\n*   **Qapital:** *Focuses more on goal-based saving, but has round-up capabilities.*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Goal-based saving, round-ups, rule-based savings (e.g., save every time you go to the gym), spending tracking.\n    *   **Pricing:** Subscription-based, several tiers with varying features (e.g., Basic, Complete, Premier).\n    *   **Investments:** ETFs.\n\n*   **Douugh:** *Banking app with built-in budgeting and investing features.*\n\n    *   **Key Features:** Checking account, budgeting tools, round-ups, and investing features.\n    *   **Pricing:** Monthly subscription fee.\n    *   **Investments:** ETFs based on your selected strategy.\n\n**Before Choosing an App, Consider:**\n\n*   **Fees:**  Carefully compare the fee structures of different apps.  Calculate how much you\u0027ll pay in fees based on your expected investment amount.  A seemingly small monthly fee can eat into your returns, especially with small balances.\n*   **Investment Options:**  Are you comfortable with pre-selected portfolios of ETFs, or do you want more control over your investments (e.g., individual stocks)?\n*   **Risk Tolerance:**  Choose a portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.  Most apps will help you assess your risk profile.\n*   **Additional Features:**  Do you need banking services, retirement accounts, or educational resources?\n*   **Security:**  Ensure the app uses robust security measures to protect your personal and financial information.  Look for features like two-factor authentication.\n*   **User Reviews:**  Read reviews from other users to get an idea of their experiences with the app.\n*   **Minimum Balance Requirements:** Check to see if they have a minimum account balance required to start investing.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Investing Involves Risk:**  Remember that all investing involves risk, and you could lose money.\n*   **Taxes:**  Keep track of your investment activity for tax purposes.  You may need to report capital gains or losses.\n*   **Read the Fine Print:**  Carefully read the terms and conditions of any app before signing up.\n\nTo give you the best recommendation, tell me a little more about what you are looking for. For example:\n\n*   **Are you a complete beginner, or do you have some investing experience?**\n*   **What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**\n*   **What is your budget for fees?**\n*   **Are there any specific features you\u0027re looking for (e.g., retirement accounts, individual stock trading)?**\n\nI can help you narrow down the best app for your needs.\n"
