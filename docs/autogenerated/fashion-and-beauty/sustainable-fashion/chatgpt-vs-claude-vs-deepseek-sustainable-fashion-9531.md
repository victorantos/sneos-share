    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive guide to sustainable fashion, covering what it means, key things to look for, and a list of notable ethical and eco-friendly brands across different categories and price points.\n\n### What is Sustainable Fashion?\n\nSustainable fashion is a holistic approach to clothing that considers the entire lifecycle of a garment. It aims to minimize the negative environmental impact and maximize social responsibility. This breaks down into two main pillars:\n\n1.  **Environmental Sustainability (Eco-Friendly):**\n    *   **Materials:** Using organic, recycled, or regeneratively farmed materials that require less water, pesticides, and energy.\n    *   **Production:** Implementing water-saving techniques, using non-toxic dyes, and prioritizing renewable energy in manufacturing.\n    *   **Waste Reduction:** Designing for durability, offering repair services, and implementing recycling or take-back programs.\n\n2.  **Social Sustainability (Ethical):**\n    *   **Fair Labor:** Ensuring safe working conditions, paying living wages, and respecting workers\u0027 rights throughout the supply chain.\n    *   **Transparency:** Being open about where and how products are made, often through certifications or detailed factory information.\n\n---\n\n### What to Look For: Certifications \u0026 Buzzwords\n\nWhen shopping, these labels and terms are good indicators of a brand\u0027s commitment:\n\n*   **Certifications:**\n    *   **GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard):** The gold standard for organic fibers, ensuring environmental and social criteria from harvesting to labeling.\n    *   **GRS (Global Recycled Standard):** Verifies the content of recycled materials in a product.\n    *   **Fair Trade Certified:** Guarantees safe working conditions and fair wages for farmers and workers.\n    *   **B Corp Certification:** Measures a company\u0027s entire social and environmental performance.\n    *   **OEKO-TEX Standard 100:** Tests for harmful substances in the final product.\n\n*   **Key Terms:**\n    *   **Organic Cotton:** Grown without toxic pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.\n    *   **Linen \u0026 Hemp:** Natural fibers that require very little water and no pesticides.\n    *   **TENCEL\u2122 Lyocell/MODAL:** Fibers made from sustainably sourced wood pulp in a closed-loop process that recycles water and solvents.\n    *   **Recycled Polyester:** Made from post-consumer plastic bottles, diverting waste from landfills.\n    *   **Deadstock Fabric:** Leftover fabric from large fashion houses that is saved from being thrown away.\n    *   **Made-to-Order:** Clothing is only produced when an order is placed, drastically reducing waste.\n\n---\n\n### Notable Sustainable Fashion Brands\n\nHere are brands leading the way in sustainability, categorized for easier browsing.\n\n#### 1.

Look for specific goals and transparency, not just vague claims (\u0022greenwashing\u0022).\n\nThe journey to a more sustainable wardrobe is a process, not a destination. Every conscious choice makes a difference."
