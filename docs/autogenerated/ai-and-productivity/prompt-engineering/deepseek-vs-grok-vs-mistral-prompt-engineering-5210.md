    "DeepSeek": "Of course! Prompt engineering is a powerful skill for HR professionals to leverage AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. It allows you to generate higher-quality, more consistent, and more relevant outputs, saving immense time and improving the quality of your work.\n\nHere are practical prompt engineering examples for HR, categorized by function, with explanations of why they work.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Talent Acquisition \u0026 Recruitment\n\n#### Example 1: Writing a Compelling Job Description\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Write a job description for a Marketing Manager.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Act as an expert HR professional. Write a compelling and inclusive job description for a **Senior Marketing Manager** in the **SaaS industry**.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Key Details:**\n\u003E - **Company:** A fast-growing B2B SaaS company focused on sustainability tech. Our culture is collaborative, data-driven, and remote-first.\n\u003E - **Key Responsibilities:** Develop and execute multi-channel marketing strategies, lead a team of 3 marketers, manage a $500k\u002B budget, and report on ROI using HubSpot and Google Analytics.\n\u003E - **Required Qualifications:** 7\u002B years in B2B SaaS marketing, proven experience with marketing automation, and strong leadership skills.\n\u003E - **Tone:** Energetic, professional, and welcoming.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Structure the output with:** A brief intro about the company, key responsibilities in bullet points, required and preferred qualifications, and a section on the benefits we offer.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It provides context (industry, company culture), specific details (team size, budget, tools), and a clear structure. This results in a ready-to-use or easily customizable JD that accurately reflects the role and employer brand.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Screening Questions Based on a JD\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Give me interview questions for a Software Engineer.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Based on the following job description for a **Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineer**, generate 8 structured interview questions that assess both technical skills and cultural fit.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Job Description Snippet:** \u0027...Must have 3\u002B years of experience with React and Node.js. Experience with AWS is a plus. We value clean code, teamwork, and a proactive problem-solving attitude...\u0027\n\u003E\n\u003E **Breakdown:**\n\u003E - 4 technical questions (2 on React, 2 on Node.js)\n\u003E - 2 behavioral questions focused on teamwork and problem-solving\n\u003E - 1 situational question about handling technical debt\n\u003E - 1 question to gauge their experience with AWS\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It asks the AI to derive questions directly from the JD\u0027s requirements, ensuring alignment. Specifying the number and type of questions creates a balanced interview guide.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Crafting a Rejection Email\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Write an email to reject a candidate.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Compose a polite and professional rejection email for a candidate who reached the final interview stage for a **Product Designer** role but was not selected. The tone should be respectful and leave the door open for future opportunities. Do not provide specific feedback on their interview performance. Keep it under 150 words.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It defines the context (final stage), specifies the tone, and includes crucial constraints (no specific feedback, word limit) to avoid potential legal issues and maintain a positive candidate experience.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Learning \u0026 Development (L\u0026D)\n\n#### Example 4: Creating a Training Module Outline\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Give me ideas for a management training program.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Develop a detailed 4-module outline for a **\u0027Managing Remote Teams\u0027** training program for new managers. The target audience is managers with 0-2 years of experience in a remote setting.\n\u003E\n\u003E **For each module, please include:**\n\u003E 1.  Module Title\n\u003E 2.  3 Key Learning Objectives\n\u003E 3.  A 30-minute interactive activity idea\n\u003E 4.  2 discussion questions to facilitate conversation\n\u003E\n\u003E **Key Topics to Cover:** Asynchronous communication, building trust remotely, preventing burnout, and running effective virtual meetings.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** The prompt forces a structured output that is immediately actionable for an L\u0026D specialist. It defines the audience, duration, and core topics, and specifies the exact components needed for each module.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 5: Drafting a Professional Development Plan\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Make a development plan for an employee.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Create a 6-month professional development plan for an **HR Coordinator** who wants to grow into an **HR Business Partner** role.\n\u003E\n\u003E **The plan should be structured as a table with four columns:**\n\u003E - **Goal Area** (e.g., Strategic Acumen, Data Analysis)\n\u003E - **Development Activity** (e.g., \u0022Shadow a senior BP in a quarterly business review\u0022)\n\u003E - **Resources/Support Needed** (e.g., \u0022Access to LinkedIn Learning \u0027HR Analytics\u0027 course\u0022)\n\u003E - **Success Metrics** (e.g., \u0022Deliver a short presentation on key HR metrics to the team\u0022)\n\u003E\n\u003E Focus on practical, on-the-job learning experiences.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** The tabular format is easy to implement and track. It focuses on actionable activities and measurable outcomes, which is the cornerstone of an effective development plan.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Employee Engagement \u0026 Communications\n\n#### Example 6: Drafting a Company-Wide Announcement\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Write an email about a new benefits policy.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Draft a clear and engaging company-wide email announcement introducing a new **\u0027Flexible Fridays\u0027** policy during the summer months. Employees can choose to log off at 1 PM on Fridays if their work is complete.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Key points to communicate:**\n\u003E - The policy is effective from June 1st to August 31st.\n\u003E - It\u0027s a pilot program to promote work-life balance.\n\u003E - Employees must coordinate with their team to ensure coverage.\n\u003E - Managers have discretion to approve based on business needs.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Tone:** Appreciative, exciting, and clear. Start with a positive subject line.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It provides all necessary information, specifies the program\u0027s temporary nature, addresses potential managerial concerns, and dictates the tone to ensure the message is received positively.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 7: Writing a Performance Review Template\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Give me a performance review form.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Design a modern performance review template focused on **continuous feedback and growth**. It should be a one-page form for managers to use during quarterly check-ins.\n\u003E\n\u003E **The template must include sections for:**\n\u003E - **Employee Self-Assessment:** What are you most proud of? Where do you want to grow?\n\u003E - **Manager Feedback:** Strengths observed and areas for development.\n\u003E - **Goals for Next Quarter:** 3-4 SMART goals.\n\u003E - **Employee\u0027s Comments:** Space for the employee to add their thoughts.\n\u003E\n\u003E Use open-ended, forward-looking questions.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It moves beyond a generic form by specifying a philosophy (\u0022continuous feedback\u0022), a frequency (\u0022quarterly\u0022), and a structure that encourages dialogue and future-focused development.\n\n---\n\n### 4. HR Strategy \u0026 Policy\n\n#### Example 8: Analyzing Employee Feedback\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022What are the main themes in this employee survey data?\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022You are an expert in organizational psychology. Analyze the following anonymous quotes from our recent employee engagement survey. Identify the **top 3 emergent themes** and for each theme, provide **one recommended action** the HR team can take to address it.\n\u003E\n\u003E **Survey Quotes:**\n\u003E [Paste 10-15 representative comments about work-life balance, career growth, and management here]\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It gives the AI a role (\u0022expert in organizational psychology\u0022), a clear task (identify themes and actions), and a direct source of data to analyze, turning qualitative data into actionable insights.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 9: Drafting a New Policy\n\n**Poor Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Write a remote work policy.\u0022\n\n**Engineered Prompt:**\n\u003E \u0022Draft a comprehensive **Remote Work Policy** for a hybrid company. The policy should be clear, fair, and cover the following key areas:\n\u003E - **Eligibility:** Which roles are eligible?\n\u003E - **Work Hours \u0026 Availability:** Core collaboration hours are 10 AM - 2 PM EST.\n\u003E - **Data Security:** Requirements for home networks and device usage.\n\u003E - **Expense Reimbursement:** Guidelines for home office equipment and internet stipends.\n\u003E - **Performance Expectations:** How performance will be evaluated based on output.\n\u003E\n\u003E Use formal but accessible language. Include a section for employee acknowledgment.\u0022\n\n**Why it works:** It outlines the specific sections required, ensuring all legal and operational bases are covered. The instruction to use \u0022formal but accessible language\u0022 is key for policy writing.\n\n---\n\n### Pro-Tips for HR Prompt Engineering:\n\n1.  **Assign a Role:** \u0022Act as an experienced HR Business Partner...\u0022 This sets the context for the AI\u0027s response.\n2.  **Provide Context:** Always include information about your company, industry, culture, and the target audience.\n3.  **Be Specific \u0026 Detailed:** The more detail you provide in the input, the more precise and useful the output will be.\n4.  **Specify the Format:** Ask for a table, bullet points, an email, or a report outline. This saves you formatting time.\n5.  **Iterate:** Your first prompt might not be perfect. Treat it like a conversation. \u0022Now, make that more formal,\u0022 or \u0022Shorten the email and add a call to action.\u0022\n\nBy mastering these prompt",
