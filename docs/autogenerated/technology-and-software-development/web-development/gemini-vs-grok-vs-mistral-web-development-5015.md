    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a roadmap for becoming a full-stack web developer, focusing on a common and well-supported stack (often called the MERN stack, but adaptable):\n\n**Important Considerations Before We Start:**\n\n*   **Pick a Track (But Stay Flexible):**  This roadmap gives a general order.  You don\u0027t have to master everything perfectly before moving on, but a solid foundation in the basics is crucial.  Also, be prepared to adjust as the landscape evolves.\n*   **Hands-On Projects are Key:**  The single most important thing is to *build things*.  Don\u0027t just read tutorials; create real projects.  Start small and gradually increase complexity.\n*   **Learn to Debug:**  Debugging is a HUGE part of programming.  Get comfortable using your browser\u0027s developer tools and the debugging tools in your chosen IDE.\n*   **Version Control (Git):**  Learn Git early and use it religiously.  This is essential for collaboration and managing your code.\n*   **Focus on Fundamentals:**  Understand the core concepts behind the technologies.  Don\u0027t just copy-paste code; understand *why* it works.\n*   **Stay Curious and Keep Learning:** Web development is constantly evolving.

    "Grok": "Full-stack web development involves both frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) technologies, along with tools for managing databases, version control, and deployment. Below is a structured roadmap to become a full-stack web developer, with technologies to learn in a logical order. Each stage builds on the previous one, and I\u0027ve included approximate time frames for learning (assuming consistent effort). Keep in mind that the exact time depends on your dedication and prior experience.\n\n### Phase 1: Fundamentals of Web Development (1-2 Months)\nGoal: Understand the basics of how the web works and build simple static websites.\n\n1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  \n   -
