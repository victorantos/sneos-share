    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of state usury laws in the United States.\n\n### Executive Summary\n\n**State usury laws** are regulations that set the maximum allowable interest rate that can be charged on a loan. There is no single \u0022US usury law\u0022; instead, each state sets its own rules, leading to a complex patchwork of regulations. These laws are designed to protect consumers from predatory lending practices.\n\n---\n\n### Key Characteristics of State Usury Laws\n\n1.  **State-Specific:** The maximum interest rate, the types of loans covered, and the penalties for violation differ significantly from state to state.\n2.  **Different Rates for Different Loans:** A state often has multiple usury limits. For example, it may have one rate for personal loans, a much higher one for payday loans, and a separate set of rules for credit cards.\n3.  **Exemptions:** Many states have laws that exempt certain types of lenders or loans from their general usury statutes. The most important federal exemption is for **national banks**.\n\n---\n\n### The National Bank Preemption: A Critical Factor\n\nA cornerstone of modern lending is the principle that **a national bank can \u0022export\u0022 the interest rate from its home state to borrowers in any other state.**\n\nThis was established by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Service Corp.* (1978). In practice, this means:\n\n*   A bank headquartered in a state with no interest rate cap (e.g., South Dakota or Delaware) can charge a borrower in a state with a strict usury cap (e.g., 12%) the higher, permissible rate of its home state.\n*   This is why major credit card issuers are based in states like South Dakota and Delaware, which have liberal lending laws. It allows them to charge high interest rates nationwide.\n\n---\n\n### Common Structures and Examples\n\nUsury limits can be structured in several ways:\n\n*   **Absolute Fixed Rate:** A simple, fixed maximum percentage (e.g., 8% per year).\n*   **Tied to a Index:** The rate is pegged to a fluctuating index, such as a certain percentage points above the **Federal Reserve discount rate** or a Treasury index. This allows the usury limit to adjust with the market.\n*   **Contract Rate:** Some states allow any rate that is explicitly agreed upon in writing by the parties.\n\nHere are a few diverse examples to illustrate the variation:\n\n*   **New York:** General civil usury rate is **16%** per annum. Criminal usury rate is **25%** per annum.\n*   **California:** The general usury limit is **10%** per annum for consumer loans, but there are numerous exceptions for licensed lenders, retail installment contracts, and more.\n*   **Arkansas:** Constitutionally sets a maximum rate of **5%** above the Federal Reserve Discount Rate.\n*   **South Dakota:** Has **no maximum interest rate cap** for many types of loans, which is why many credit card banks are located there.\n\n---\n\n### Special Categories with Different Rules\n\nMany states create special, higher usury limits for specific, often high-risk, loan products:\n\n1.  **Payday Loans:** These are typically exempt from general usury laws and are governed by their own statutes. The interest rates are extremely high, often amounting to an **Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 400% or more**. States regulate these through fee structures rather than interest rates.\n2.  **Credit Cards:** As explained under the national bank preemption, credit card rates are generally set by the bank\u0027s home state law, not the borrower\u0027s state law.\n3.  **Pawnbroker Loans:** Regulated under separate statutes that allow for high fees and interest rates for these secured, short-term loans.\n\n---\n\n### Penalties for Violation\n\nPenalties for charging a usurious rate vary by state but can be severe:\n\n*   Forfeiture of all interest on the loan.\n*   Forfeiture of double or triple the interest charged.\n*   In some cases, forfeiture of the entire principal amount of the loan.\n*   Criminal penalties (fines or imprisonment) in states with criminal usury statutes.\n\n---\n\n### How to Find the Specific Law for a State\n\n1.  **State Legislature Website:** Search for the state\u0027s \u0022Code\u0022 or \u0022Revised Statutes.\u0022 Look for titles like \u0022Commerce and Trade,\u0022 \u0022Financial Institutions,\u0022 or \u0022Interest and Usury.\u0022\n2.  **State Banking Department/Regulator:** The state agency that regulates financial institutions often provides summaries or guidance on usury limits.\n3.  **Legal Databases:** Services like Westlaw or LexisNexis provide direct access to the statutes.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for general educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Lending laws are complex and constantly changing. Always consult with a qualified legal professional for advice on a specific situation.",
    "Gemini": "Usury laws are state laws that limit the amount of interest a lender can charge on a loan. These laws vary significantly from state to state and can be complex. Here\u0027s a general overview, but remember to consult with legal counsel or research the specific laws in your state for accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n**Key Aspects of State Usury Laws:**\n\n*   **Interest Rate Limits:** The primary function of usury laws is to set maximum interest rates. These limits differ depending on the type of loan (e.g., personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, payday loans). Some states have one general usury rate, while others have different rates for different loan categories.\n*   **Types of Loans Covered:** Usury laws typically apply to various types of loans, but there are often exceptions. Common loan types covered include:\n    *   Personal loans\n    *   Mortgages\n    *   Credit cards\n    *   Payday loans\n    *   Vehicle loans\n    *   Business loans (sometimes)\n*   **Exemptions:** Many states have exemptions to usury laws. Common exemptions include:\n    *   **Federally insured banks and credit unions:** Federal law often preempts state usury laws for these institutions.\n    *   **Certain types of lenders:** Some states exempt specific lenders, such as licensed financial institutions, pawn brokers or title lenders, from general usury laws, but often regulate them under separate legislation.\n    *   **Large loans to corporations or businesses:** Loans above a certain dollar amount to corporations or businesses may be exempt. This is because businesses are often considered more sophisticated borrowers.\n    *   **Real estate transactions:** Mortgages and other real estate-secured loans sometimes have different usury limits or are exempt.\n    *   **Loans made under specific state or federal programs:** Some loans guaranteed or subsidized by government programs are exempt.\n*   **Penalties for Violation:** If a lender violates usury laws, the penalties can vary. Common penalties include:\n    *   **Forfeiture of interest:** The lender may be required to forfeit all or part of the interest charged.\n    *   **Forfeiture of principal:** In some cases, the borrower may not have to repay the principal amount of the loan.\n    *   **Civil lawsuits:** Borrowers may be able to sue lenders for damages.\n    *   **Criminal charges:** In some extreme cases, usury can be a criminal offense.\n*   **Calculating Interest:** State laws often define how interest is calculated for usury purposes. This can include factors like:\n    *   **Fees:** Some fees charged by the lender may be considered interest.\n    *   **Points:** Loan origination fees (points) may be included in the interest calculation.\n    *   **Other charges:** Any other charges the borrower is required to pay as a condition of the loan might be considered interest.\n*   **\u0022Choice of Law\u0022 Provisions:** Loan agreements sometimes include a \u0022choice of law\u0022 provision, specifying which state\u0027s laws govern the agreement. However, a state may refuse to enforce a choice of law provision if it finds that the provision was designed to evade its own usury laws.\n\n**How to Find Your State\u0027s Usury Laws:**\n\n1.  **State Government Websites:** Look for your state\u0027s banking department, attorney general\u0027s office, or department of financial institutions. These agencies often have information on usury laws.\n\n2.  **State Statutes:** Look up your state\u0027s statutes online through a legal research service or your state\u0027s legislative website. Search for terms like \u0022usury,\u0022 \u0022interest rates,\u0022 \u0022loan limits,\u0022 or \u0022consumer credit.\u0022\n\n3.  **Legal Professionals:** Consult with an attorney who specializes in consumer finance or lending laws in your state.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Payday Loans and Title Loans:** Many states have specific laws regulating payday loans and title loans, which often involve very high interest rates. These laws may impose stricter limits and regulations than general usury laws.\n*   **Federal Preemption:** As mentioned, federal law can sometimes preempt state usury laws, particularly for national banks and credit unions.\n*   **Evolving Laws:** Usury laws can change, so it\u0027s essential to stay updated on the current laws in your state.\n*   **Online Lending:** The rise of online lending has created new challenges for enforcing usury laws, as lenders may operate across state lines.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide legal advice.
