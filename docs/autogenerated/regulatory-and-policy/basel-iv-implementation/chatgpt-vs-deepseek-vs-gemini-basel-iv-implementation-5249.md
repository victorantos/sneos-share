    "ChatGPT": "Error calling OpenAI API.",
    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a detailed timeline of the Basel IV reforms, including key implementation dates and the current status.\n\n### Executive Summary: What is \u0022Basel IV\u0022?\n\n\u0022Basel IV\u0022 is the unofficial name for a comprehensive set of banking regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). It is **not a separate framework** but rather the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis reforms. Its main goals are to:\n\n1.  **Restore credibility in risk-weighted assets (RWAs):** Reduce variability in how banks calculate their capital requirements.\n2.  **Enhance the resilience of banks:** Ensure they hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during periods of stress.\n3.  **Level the playing field:** Create more consistency in regulatory capital outcomes across banks and jurisdictions.\n\nThe reforms are packaged as the **\u0022Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms\u0022** standard.\n\n---\n\n### The Official Timeline: Key Dates and Milestones\n\nThe following timeline outlines the major milestones from the initial agreement to the current implementation phase.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060mermaid\ntimeline\n    title Basel IV Implementation Timeline\n    section Finalization \u0026 Agreement\n    2017 : Final Standards Published\u003Cbr\u003E(Dec 2017)\n    section Initial Implementation Timeline\n    2022 : Original Start Date\u003Cbr\u003E(1 Jan 2022)\n    2023 : Original Full\u003Cbr\u003EImplementation (1 Jan 2023)\n    section Revised Timeline (COVID Impact)\n    2023 : Revised Start Date\u003Cbr\u003E(1 Jan 2023)\n    2028 : Revised Full\u003Cbr\u003EImplementation (1 Jan 2028)\n    section Current Status\n    2024-Present : Phased Implementation\u003Cbr\u003Ein Progress\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n#### Key Deadlines for Implementation\n\nThe most important deadlines for the phased implementation are:\n\n| Reform Component | Implementation Date |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Output Floor** | Phased in over 5 years, starting at **50%** on 1 Jan 2023 and rising by **5% each year** to the final level of **72.5%** on **1 Jan 2028**. |\n| **Revised Standardised Approaches**\u003Cbr\u003E(Credit Risk, CVA, Operational Risk) | **1 January 2023** |\n| **Revised Internal Models Frameworks**\u003Cbr\u003E(e.g., for Credit Risk, Market Risk) | **1 January 2023** (Market Risk: \u0022FRTB\u0022 implementation dates vary slightly by jurisdiction) |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown of the Reforms and Their Phase-In\n\nThe Basel IV package consists of several interconnected pillars. Here\u2019s how they are being implemented:\n\n#### 1. Output Floor\nThis is a cornerstone of Basel IV. It places a **floor** on the capital requirements calculated using a bank\u0027s internal models. The floor is based on a percentage of the capital required under the standardized approaches (set at **72.5%**).\n\n*   **Phase-in Period:** The floor is being phased in over **five years** to allow banks time to adjust.\n    *   **2023:** 50% of the floor\n    *   **2024:** 55%\n    *   **2025:** 60%\n    *   **2026:** 65%\n    *   **2027:** 70%\n    *   **2028:** 72.5% (fully implemented)\n\n#### 2. Revised Standardised Approaches\nThese are more robust and risk-sensitive methods that serve as the baseline for the Output Floor.\n*   **Credit Risk:** New, more granular risk weights for exposures like banks, corporates, and real estate. It removes reliance on external credit ratings in some areas.\n*   **Operational Risk:** Replaces older methods with a single, standardized approach (the \u0022Business Indicator Multiplier\u0022) based on a bank\u0027s income and historical losses.\n*   **Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk:** Revisions to the framework for capturing the risk of counterparty default.\n\nThese standardized approaches became effective from **January 1, 2023**.\n\n#### 3. Constraints on Internal Models\nThe use of internal models for calculating capital has been significantly constrained to reduce complexity and variability.\n*   **Credit Risk:** Banks can no longer use internal models for certain asset classes (e.g., large corporates, financial institutions), forcing them to use the standardized approach.\n*   **Market Risk:** The \u0022Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB)\u0022 introduces a new, more rigorous internal models approach and a revised standardized approach.\n\nThe implementation of the market risk rules (FRTB) is aligned with the broader Basel IV timeline, with many jurisdictions setting deadlines around **2025**.\n\n---\n\n### Jurisdictional Variations: The US and EU\n\nWhile the BCBS sets global standards, **each jurisdiction implements them in its own way and on its own schedule.**\n\n*   **United States:** The US banking agencies have proposed their version of the rules, often referred to as the **\u0022Basel III Endgame\u0022**. The US proposal is generally more stringent and applies to a wider range of banks than the BCBS standard. The final rule is expected in **2024**, with a multi-year implementation period likely to follow.\n*   **European Union:** The EU has already implemented the bulk of the reforms through its **\u0022Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) III\u0022** and **\u0022Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) VI\u0022** package. The implementation date for most of these rules in the EU is **January 1, 2025**, with some elements having a later start.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Basel IV is the finalization of the Basel III reforms.**\n*   The **global implementation** began on **January 1, 2023**.\n*   The key **Output Floor is being phased in** until it reaches **72.5% on January 1, 2028**.\n*   **Timelines differ by region** (e.g., EU in 2025, US timeline TBD), so it\u0027s crucial to check the specific rules for a given jurisdiction.\n\nFor the most current information, it is always best to consult the official websites of the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** and your local banking regulator (e.g., Federal Reserve, ECB, PRA).",
    "Gemini": "The Basel IV timeline has been subject to revisions and delays. Here\u0027s a general overview of the key milestones and current expectations:\n\n**Key Milestones and Current Expectations:**\n\n*   **Initial Announcement:** The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized the Basel IV (also known as Basel III Endgame) reforms in **December 2017**.\n\n*   **Original Implementation Date:** The initial implementation date was set for **January 1, 2022**.\n\n*   **Delayed Implementation:** Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other considerations, the implementation date was **delayed by one year to January 1, 2023**.\n\n*   **Further Delay for Output Floor:** There was a phased implementation, with the output floor being introduced gradually. The full implementation of the output floor is expected by **January 1, 2028**.\n\n*   **Phased Implementation:** The rules are being phased in over a period of years.\n\n**Key Components and their Rollout:**\n\n*   **Revised Standardized Approach for Credit Risk:** Expected to be implemented along with the other Basel IV components.\n\n*   **Revised Internal Model Approach for Credit Risk:** Also part of the broader implementation.\n\n*   **Revised Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk Framework:** Included in the overall Basel IV package.\n\n*   **Operational Risk Framework:** Part of the implementation.\n\n*   **Leverage Ratio Buffer for Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs):** Being phased in.\n\n*   **Output Floor:** The key aspect to watch.  It limits the capital relief banks can get from using their internal models. This will be phased in annually, beginning in **January 2023**, ultimately reaching 72.5% by **January 1, 2028**.\n\n**Summary Timeline:**\n\n*   **December 2017:** Basel IV finalized.\n*   **January 1, 2023:** Initial implementation (delayed from 2022).  Phased implementation of many components begins.\n*   **January 1, 2028:** Full implementation of the output floor (72.5%).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Jurisdictional Implementation:** The Basel Committee sets the standards, but individual jurisdictions (e.g., the US, EU, individual countries) are responsible for implementing them into their national regulations.  The *actual* timeline can vary by jurisdiction.  Therefore, it\u0027s crucial to check the specific regulations in the regions relevant to the banks in question.\n*   **Ongoing Refinements:** Regulatory standards are often subject to revisions and clarifications. It\u0027s essential to stay updated on the latest developments from the Basel Committee and relevant national regulators.\n*   **Complexity:** Basel IV is a complex set of rules, and interpretations can vary.\n\nTo get the *most accurate* and up-to-date timeline, it is essential to refer to the official announcements and guidelines from:\n\n*   **The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS):** The source of the original standards.\n*   **National Regulatory Authorities:**  Such as the Federal Reserve (US), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and other relevant bodies in specific countries.  These are the bodies that translate the Basel standards into legally binding rules.\n\nIn conclusion, while the general framework is established, the specific implementation timelines and details can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction.\n"
