    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s craft a comprehensive flexibility and mobility routine to improve your range of motion. To make this routine effective and safe, I\u0027ll need a little more information.  **Please tell me:**\n\n1.  **Your current fitness level:** Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced exerciser?\n2.  **Any injuries or limitations:** Do you have any pain, injuries, or conditions (e.g., tight hamstrings, stiff shoulders, lower back pain) that I should be aware of?\n3.  **Your goals:** What specific areas are you looking to improve? (e.g., hamstrings, shoulders, hips, back, ankles).\n4. **How much time do you have?** How much time are you able to devote to this routine?\n\nIn the meantime, here\u0027s a sample routine that is designed for people who are intermediate level with no injuries to any parts of the body. \n\n**Important Considerations Before Starting:**\n\n*   **Warm-up:**  Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., marching in place, arm circles, leg swings) and dynamic stretches before static stretching.\n*   **Cool-down:** Cool down with 5-10 minutes of slow walking and static stretches.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:**  Never force a stretch.  You should feel a gentle pull, not pain.  If you feel pain, ease up on the stretch.\n*   **Breathe:**  Breathe deeply and evenly throughout each stretch.  Exhale as you deepen the stretch.\n*   **Consistency:**  Aim to do this routine 3-5 times per week for best results.\n*   **Progression:**  As you get more flexible, you can gradually increase the duration of the stretches or explore more challenging variations.\n*   **Hydration:** Stay hydrated by drinking water before, during, and after your routine.\n*   **Modifications:** If a stretch feels uncomfortable or painful, modify it or skip it altogether. There are always alternative stretches.\n*   **Consult a Professional:** If you have any underlying medical conditions or concerns, consult with a physical therapist or certified personal trainer before starting this or any new exercise program.\n\n**Sample Flexibility and Mobility Routine:**\n\nThis routine focuses on major muscle groups and joints.  The routine includes dynamic and static stretches.\n\n**I.

Look for videos from reputable sources like physical therapists or certified trainers.\n*   **Consistency is Key:** The more consistently you perform this routine, the faster you\u0027ll see results.\n\nOnce you provide the requested information, I can customize this routine to make it even more effective for you!
