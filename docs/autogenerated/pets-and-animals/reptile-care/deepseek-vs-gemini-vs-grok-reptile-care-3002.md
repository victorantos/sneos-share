    "DeepSeek": "Of course! Welcome to the wonderful world of herpetology! Choosing a reptile as a pet is an exciting step, but it\u0027s crucial to start with the right knowledge to ensure a long, healthy life for your new companion.\n\nThis guide will cover the fundamentals of reptile care for a beginner.\n\n### The Golden Rule of Reptile Care\n\n**You are recreating a tiny piece of the wild in a box.** Your primary job is to replicate their natural environment as closely as possible. This is done by controlling the **Husbandry Big 4**:\n\n1.  **Heat**\n2.  **Humidity**\n3.  **Lighting**\n4.  **Space (Enclosure)**\n\nGet these four things right, and you\u0027re 90% of the way to being a great reptile owner.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Choose the RIGHT Beginner Reptile\n\nThis is the most important decision you will make. Avoid the impulse buy! Do your research *before* you even look at an animal.\n\n**Top 5 Recommended Beginner Reptiles:**\n\n1.  **Leopard Gecko**\n    *   **Why they\u0027re great:** Docile, small, easy to handle, and have simple dietary needs (insects only).\n    *   **Care Level:** Very Easy.\n    *   **Key Need:** A simple under-tank heater (UTH) for belly heat. They do not require special UVB lighting if supplemented correctly, but it is still recommended.\n\n2.  **Crested Gecko**\n    *   **Why they\u0027re great:** Can live in a tall, planted terrarium, which is beautiful to look at. Their diet is primarily a pre-mixed powdered diet you mix with water.\n    *   **Care Level:** Very Easy.\n    *   **Key Need:** A tall enclosure with plenty of branches and foliage to climb and hide in. Moderate to high humidity.\n\n3.  **Corn Snake**\n    *   **Why they\u0027re great:** Arguably the best beginner snake. Docile, reluctant to bite, and a voracious eater. They come in countless beautiful colors (morphs).\n    *   **Care Level:** Easy.\n    *   **Key Need:** A secure enclosure with a locking lid\u2014they are escape artists!\n\n4.  **Ball Python**\n    *   **Why they\u0027re great:** Incredibly docile and known for their \u0022balling up\u0022 defense mechanism. They are slow-moving and easy to handle.\n    *   **Care Level:** Easy to Intermediate.\n    *   **Key Need:** Consistent humidity (60-70%) and a perfect thermal gradient can be tricky for first-timers. Some can be picky eaters.\n\n5.  **Bearded Dragon**\n    *   **Why they\u0027re great:** Personable, active during the day, and often seem to enjoy human interaction.\n    *   **Care Level:** Intermediate.\n    *   **Key Need:** They require a large enclosure, intense heat, and **specific, mandatory UVB lighting** to survive. Their diet is a mix of insects and vegetables.\n\n**Reptiles to AVOID as a Beginner:**\n*   Green Iguanas (large, aggressive, complex care)\n*   Chameleons (stress easily, very specific and delicate care)\n*   Red-Eared Sliders (get huge, live for decades, messy)\n*   Any wild-caught animal\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Master the Husbandry Big 4\n\n#### 1. Heat\nReptiles are ectotherms; they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperature.\n*   **Thermal Gradient:** This is non-negotiable. The enclosure must have a **hot side** and a **cool side**. This allows the reptile to move between temperatures to digest, become active, or cool down.\n*   **Heat Sources:** Under-tank heaters (UTH), ceramic heat emitters (CHE), or halogen bulbs. Avoid \u0022hot rocks\u0022 as they can cause severe burns.\n*   **Control:** **Always use a thermostat** with any heat source. This is a safety device that prevents it from overheating and burning your pet or causing a fire.\n\n#### 2. Humidity\nThe required humidity level is species-specific.\n*   **Low Humidity:** Leopard Geckos, Bearded Dragons (30-40%).\n*   **High Humidity:** Crested Geckos, Ball Pythons (60-80%).\n*   **How to Measure:** Use a digital hygrometer (avoid analog dials, they are often inaccurate).\n*   **How to Adjust:** Mist the enclosure with a spray bottle, add a larger water bowl, or use a humidifier for high humidity. Increase ventilation for low humidity.\n\n#### 3. Lighting\nThis is more than just a light bulb for you to see your pet.\n*   **UVA:** Promotes natural behaviors like feeding and breeding.\n*   **UVB:** **Critical for many species.** It allows them to synthesize Vitamin D3, which is necessary to absorb calcium. Without it, they develop Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD), a painful and fatal condition.\n*   **Rule of Thumb:** Most diurnal (day-active) reptiles like Bearded Dragons **require** UVB lighting. Nocturnal species like Leopard Geckos can survive without it if properly supplemented, but it is still beneficial. **Research your specific species!**\n\n#### 4. Space (Enclosure)\nStart with an enclosure that will fit your reptile as an adult. \u0022Growing with your pet\u0022 often means stressful and costly upgrades.\n*   **Size:** Bigger is almost always better, as long as it\u0027s well-furnished.\n*   **Security:** Lids must be secure and lockable.\n*   **Furnishings:**\n    *   **Hides:** At least two\u2014one on the warm side, one on the cool side. Feeling secure reduces stress.\n    *   **Substrate:** This is the flooring. For beginners, **avoid loose substrates like sand, mulch, or bark** until you are very experienced, as they can cause impaction if ingested. Start with paper towel, reptile carpet, or tile for easy cleaning and safety.\n    *   **Climbing/Basking:** Branches, rocks, and vines.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Feeding and Hydration\n\n*   **Diet:** Is your reptile an herbivore, carnivore, or insectivore? Research their specific diet.\n    *   **Insects:** Must be \u0022gut-loaded\u0022 (fed nutritious food) before being fed to your reptile.\n    *   **Supplements:** Dust insects or food with **Calcium (with D3 if no UVB, without D3 if with UVB)** and a multivitamin powder. The schedule varies by species.\n*   **Water:** Always provide a clean, fresh bowl of water. Some species, like Crested Geckos, will drink water droplets from leaves after misting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Health and Handling\n\n*   **Quarantine:** When you first bring your reptile home, leave it completely alone for at least one week. No handling, just change water and feed. This allows it to de-stress and acclimate.\n*   **Handling:** Move slowly and confidently. Never grab from above (like a predator). Scoop from below. Support their body fully. Keep handling sessions short (5-15 minutes) at first.\n*   **Signs of a Healthy Reptile:**\n    *   Clear, bright eyes\n    *   Active and alert\n    *   Eats regularly\n    *   Firm, well-formed droppings\n    *   Sheds its skin in complete pieces\n*   **Signs of Illness (Time for a Vet!):**\n    *   Lethargy or weakness\n    *   Loss of appetite for multiple feedings\n    *   Wheezing, mucus around the nose or mouth (Respiratory Infection)\n    *   Swollen joints or soft, rubbery jaw (Metabolic Bone Disease)\n    *   Incomplete sheds (dysecdysis), especially if skin is stuck around toes or eyes\n\n### Final Pro-Tips for Beginners\n\n1.  **The Setup Cost \u003E The Animal Cost.** The reptile itself is often the cheapest part. The enclosure, heater, thermostat, lighting, and decor will be several hundred dollars. Be prepared.\n2.  **Find a Vet *Before* You Need One.** Locate an exotics vet in your area that sees reptiles. Don\u0027t wait for an emergency.\n3.  **Trusted Sources:** Use reputable care guides from sites like **Reptifiles.com**, forums, and books. Avoid pet store advice unless you can verify it.\n4.  **Patience is Everything.** Reptiles operate on their own schedule. They may not eat, come out, or want to be handled when you do. Be patient and respect their nature.\n\nReptiles are incredibly rewarding pets that can live for many years. By starting with an appropriate species and dedicating yourself to proper care, you\u0027ll be set up for a fantastic experience. Welcome to the hobby",
    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s dive into reptile care!  It can be a rewarding experience, but it\u0027s essential to do your research and be prepared. This guide will cover the basics, but **remember that this is a general overview. Specific needs vary greatly between species. Thorough research on your *chosen* reptile species is crucial before acquiring it.**\n\n**I.  Before You Get a Reptile: Planning is Key**\n\n*   **Choose the Right Species:** This is the MOST important step.\n    *   **Beginner-Friendly Options:**  Some reptiles are generally considered easier for beginners due to their hardiness and simpler care requirements.  Examples include:\n        *   **Leopard Geckos:** Relatively easy to handle, insectivores, don\u0027t need extremely high humidity, and are generally docile.\n        *   **Crested Geckos:** Arboreal (live in trees), fruit and insect diet, tolerate handling well, moderate humidity requirements.\n        *   **Bearded Dragons:** Docile and interactive, diurnal (active during the day), need a larger enclosure, require a varied diet of insects and vegetables.\n        *   **Corn Snakes:** Docile, relatively small, eat mice, and have simple temperature and humidity needs.\n    *   **Avoid Difficult Species:**  Many reptiles have specialized needs or are more challenging to care for. Avoid these as a beginner:\n        *   Chameleons (very specific humidity and lighting)\n        *   Green Iguanas (grow very large and need specialized care)\n        *   Snapping Turtles (aggressive and require large aquatic setups)\n        *   Boas and Pythons (can get very large and require experience)\n\n*   **Research, Research, Research:**  Don\u0027t rely solely on pet store advice. Use reliable sources like:\n    *   **Species-Specific Care Sheets:** Search \u0022[Reptile Species Name] care sheet\u0022 online.  Look for information from reputable breeders, reptile rescues, or universities.\n    *   **Reptile Forums and Communities:**  Engage with experienced keepers online.  (e.g., Reddit\u0027s r/reptiles, or species-specific forums).\n    *   **Books:**  Many excellent books are available on reptile care.\n    *   **Veterinarians:** Find a veterinarian experienced with reptiles in your area *before* you get your reptile. You\u0027ll need them for check-ups and emergencies.\n\n*   **Cost Considerations:** Reptile ownership can be expensive.\n    *   **Initial Setup:** Enclosure, heating, lighting, substrate, hides, water bowls, food dishes.\n    *   **Ongoing Costs:** Food, substrate replacement, supplements, electricity for heating and lighting, vet care.\n    *   **Unexpected Costs:** Emergency vet visits can be expensive.\n\n*   **Commitment:** Reptiles can live for many years (some species for decades).  Be sure you\u0027re prepared for a long-term commitment.\n\n**II.  Setting Up the Enclosure (Terrarium/Vivarium)**\n\n*   **Enclosure Size:**  Bigger is generally better. Research the *adult* size of your chosen species and provide an enclosure that allows for comfortable movement.  Enclosures that are too small are a common source of stress.\n    *   **Material:** Glass terrariums are common and allow for good visibility.  Plastic tubs can be a more affordable option, especially for snakes.\n    *   **Secure Lid:**  Reptiles are escape artists!  Make sure the lid is secure and locking if necessary.\n\n*   **Substrate:**  The material that lines the bottom of the enclosure.  Choose a substrate appropriate for your species\u0027 needs.\n    *   **Considerations:**  Humidity, digging behavior, impaction risk (if ingested).\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Leopard Geckos:** Paper towels (easy to clean), reptile carpet, bioactive substrate (soil mixture with live plants and cleanup crew). Avoid sand, as it can cause impaction.\n        *   **Bearded Dragons:** Reptile carpet, tile, paper towels.  Avoid sand or loose substrates for young dragons.\n        *   **Corn Snakes:** Aspen shavings, paper towels.\n    *   **Bioactive Substrates:** These substrates contain live beneficial bacteria and invertebrates (like isopods and springtails) that break down waste and maintain a healthy environment. Requires more research and management.\n\n*   **Heating:** Reptiles are ectothermic (cold-blooded) and rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.\n    *   **Heat Source Options:**\n        *   **Heat Lamps (Basking Bulbs):** Provide focused heat for basking. Use a ceramic heat emitter (CHE) for nighttime heat, as it doesn\u0027t emit light.\n        *   **Under-Tank Heaters (UTHs):**  Heat from below.  Must be used with a thermostat to prevent burns.\n    *   **Temperature Gradient:**  Provide a temperature gradient within the enclosure, with a warm basking spot and a cooler end.  This allows the reptile to regulate its body temperature by moving between warm and cool areas.\n    *   **Thermostat:**  Essential to regulate the temperature and prevent overheating.\n    *   **Thermometers:**  Use multiple thermometers to monitor temperatures in different areas of the enclosure.\n\n*   **Lighting:**\n    *   **UVB Lighting:**  Essential for many reptiles, especially diurnal species like Bearded Dragons. UVB light allows them to synthesize vitamin D3, which is necessary for calcium absorption and bone health.\n        *   **UVB Bulbs:**  Choose a UVB bulb specifically designed for reptiles.  Replace bulbs regularly (every 6-12 months), even if they still emit light, as the UVB output degrades over time.\n        *   **Placement:**  The UVB bulb should be placed within the correct distance from the basking spot, as recommended by the manufacturer.  It should not be blocked by glass or plastic.\n    *   **Visible Light:**  Provides a natural day/night cycle.  A simple daylight bulb can be used.\n\n*   **Humidity:**  Maintaining the correct humidity is crucial for shedding and overall health.\n    *   **Hygrometer:**  Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level.\n    *   **Humidity Control:**\n        *   **Misting:**  Spray the enclosure with water to increase humidity.\n        *   **Water Bowl:**  A larger water bowl will increase humidity.\n        *   **Humid Hide:**  A hide filled with moist substrate (like sphagnum moss) can provide a humid microclimate.\n\n*   **Hides:**  Provide multiple hides in different areas of the enclosure.  Hides give reptiles a sense of security and reduce stress.\n\n*   **Water Bowl:**  Provide a clean water bowl at all times.  The water bowl should be shallow enough for the reptile to easily access and should be cleaned and refilled daily.\n\n*   **Decor:**  Add branches, rocks, plants (live or artificial), and other decorations to enrich the environment.  Make sure decorations are secure and won\u0027t fall on the reptile.\n\n**III.  Feeding**\n\n*   **Diet:**  The diet will vary depending on the species.\n    *   **Insectivores:**  Eat insects (crickets, mealworms, dubia roaches, etc.).\n    *   **Carnivores:** Eat whole prey (mice, rats).\n    *   **Herbivores:** Eat vegetables and greens.\n    *   **Omnivores:** Eat a combination of insects, vegetables, and fruits.\n    *   **Gut-Loading:**  Feed insects a nutritious diet before feeding them to your reptile.\n    *   **Supplementation:**  Dust insects with calcium and vitamin D3 supplements.\n*   **Feeding Schedule:**  The frequency of feeding will depend on the species and age of the reptile.\n*   **Handling Food:**  Use tongs to offer food, especially to snakes.\n\n**IV.  Handling**\n\n*   **Start Slowly:**  Allow your reptile to acclimate to its new environment for a few days before attempting to handle it.\n*   **Gentle Approach:**  Approach the reptile slowly and gently.  Avoid sudden movements.\n*   **Support the Body:**  When handling, support the reptile\u0027s body.\n*   **Wash Your Hands:**  Wash your hands before and after handling reptiles.\n*   **Supervision:**  Supervise children when they are handling reptiles.\n*   **Respect Boundaries:**  If the reptile is showing signs of stress (e.g., hissing, biting, trying to escape), put it back in its enclosure and try again later.\n*   **Never handle after feeding.**\n\n**V.  Health and Hygiene**\n\n*   **Quarantine:**  If you are introducing a new reptile to an existing collection, quarantine it for at least 30-60 days to prevent the spread of disease.\n*   **Cleaning:**  Clean the enclosure regularly.  Remove feces and uneaten food daily.  Replace the substrate as needed.  Disinfect the enclosure periodically.\n*   **Shedding:**  Reptiles shed their skin.  Provide a humid environment to help them shed properly.\n*   **Common Health Problems:**\n    *   **Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD):**  Caused by a lack of calcium and vitamin D3.\n    *   **Respiratory Infections:**  Caused by poor ventilation or low humidity.\n    *   **Parasites:**  Can be internal or external.\n    *   **Impaction:**  Caused by ingesting indigestible materials (e.g., sand).\n*   **Veterinary Care:**  Find a veterinarian experienced with reptiles in your area.  Schedule regular check-ups.  Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness.\n\n**VI.  Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Legality:** Check your local and state laws regarding reptile ownership. Some species may be restricted or require permits.\n*   **Salmonella:** Reptiles can carry Salmonella bacteria, which can be harmful to humans. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling reptiles or anything in their enclosure.\n*   **Never release a pet reptile into the wild.** It can be harmful to the environment and to native species.\n\n**VII.  Troubleshooting**\n\n*   **Not Eating:**  Stress, incorrect temperature, or illness can cause a reptile to stop eating.\n*   **Difficulty Shedding:**  Low humidity is the most common cause of shedding problems.\n*   **Lethargy:**  Can be a sign of illness or incorrect temperature.\n*   **Abnormal Feces:**  Can be a sign of parasites or other health problems.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Research your chosen species thoroughly.**\n*   **Provide the correct temperature, humidity, and lighting.**\n*   **Offer a balanced and nutritious diet.**\n*   **Clean the enclosure regularly.**\n*   **Monitor your reptile\u0027s health and behavior.**\n*   **Find a qualified reptile veterinarian.**\n\nReptile keeping can be a wonderful hobby.  Enjoy your scaly friend! Remember to consult with experienced keepers and veterinary professionals as needed. Good luck!\n",
    "Grok": "Caring for a reptile as a beginner can be rewarding, but it requires research and dedication since reptiles have specific needs that differ from other pets like dogs or cats. This guide will cover the basics of reptile care to help you get started. Remember, different species have unique requirements, so always research the specific needs of the reptile you plan to adopt.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Research Before Choosing a Reptile\nBefore bringing a reptile home, understand the species you\u2019re interested in. Some reptiles are more beginner-friendly than others. Popular beginner reptiles include:\n- **Leopard Gecko**: Small, easy to handle, doesn\u2019t require complex lighting or humidity.\n- **Bearded Dragon**: Hardy, friendly, and active during the day.\n- **Corn Snake**: Docile, low-maintenance, and doesn\u2019t grow too large.\n- **Crested Gecko**: Low-maintenance, doesn\u2019t need special lighting, good for small spaces.\n\nAvoid species like iguanas, monitors, or venomous snakes as they require advanced care, space, or can be dangerous.\n\n**Questions to Ask:**\n- How big will it grow, and what size enclosure will it need?\n- What is its lifespan (many live 10-20\u002B years)?\n- What are its dietary, temperature, and humidity needs?\n- Is it nocturnal or diurnal (active at night or day)?\n- Does it require a lot of handling or socialization?\n\n---\n\n### 2. Set Up the Right Habitat\nReptiles are ectothermic (cold-blooded), meaning they rely on their environment to regulate body temperature. Their habitat must mimic their natural conditions.\n\n#### Enclosure\n- **Size**: Depends on the species. For example, a leopard gecko needs a 10-20 gallon tank, while a bearded dragon may need 40-75 gallons as an adult.\n- **Type**: Glass tanks, plastic tubs, or custom enclosures can work. Ensure good ventilation and secure lids.\n- **Substrate**: Use a safe substrate (floor covering) like reptile carpet, paper towels, or coconut fiber. Avoid sand for most beginners as it can cause impaction if ingested.\n\n#### Temperature\n- Reptiles need a temperature gradient with a warm side (basking area) and a cool side to thermoregulate.\n- Use a heat source like an under-tank heater, heat lamp, or ceramic heat emitter.\n- Monitor temperature with a reliable thermometer (digital is best).\n  - Example: Bearded dragons need a basking spot of 95-110\u00B0F (35-43\u00B0C) and a cool side of 75-85\u00B0F (24-29\u00B0C).\n- Avoid hot rocks as they can cause burns.\n\n#### Lighting\n- Many reptiles need UVB lighting to synthesize vitamin D3 and prevent metabolic bone disease (MBD).\n- Use a UVB bulb (5.0 or 10.0 depending on species) and replace it every 6-12 months as UVB output diminishes.\n- Provide a day/night cycle (12-14 hours of light, 10-12 hours of dark) using a timer.\n\n#### Humidity\n- Some reptiles, like tropical geckos, need high humidity (60-80%), while desert species like bearded dragons need lower humidity (30-40%).\n- Use a hygrometer to measure humidity.\n- Maintain humidity with misting, a water bowl, or a humidifier. Ensure good ventilation to prevent mold.\n\n#### Hides and Decor\n- Provide hiding spots (caves, logs) on both warm and cool sides for security.\n- Add branches, rocks, or plants (live or fake) for climbing and enrichment. Ensure they are stable to avoid injury.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Feeding and Nutrition\nReptiles have varied diets depending on whether they are herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.\n- **Herbivores** (e.g., tortoises): Eat leafy greens, vegetables, and occasional fruits. Avoid iceberg lettuce as it lacks nutrients.\n- **Carnivores** (e.g., snakes): Eat rodents, insects, or fish. Pre-killed/frozen-thawed prey is safer than live for snakes.\n- **Omnivores** (e.g., bearded dragons): Eat a mix of insects (crickets, dubia roaches) and vegetables.\n- **Supplements**: Dust insects or food with calcium powder (with or without D3) and multivitamins as per species needs to prevent deficiencies.\n\n**Feeding Tips:**\n- Feed appropriate portion sizes and frequency (e.g., juvenile bearded dragons eat daily, adults eat every 2-3 days).\n- Provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish daily. Some reptiles soak in water, so ensure it\u2019s safe and shallow.\n- Remove uneaten food to prevent spoilage or pests.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Handling and Interaction\n- **Start Slow**: Let your reptile settle into its new home for a few days or weeks before handling.\n- **Be Gentle**: Support their body (don\u2019t grab by the tail\u2014some lizards can drop their tail as a defense mechanism).\n- **Wash Hands**: Always wash your hands before and after handling to prevent spreading germs (reptiles can carry salmonella).\n- **Limit Stress**: Don\u2019t handle them too often or for too long, especially if they seem stressed (hissing, puffing up, hiding).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Health and Hygiene\nReptiles hide illness well, so monitor for signs of problems:\n- Lack of appetite\n- Lethargy\n- Weight loss\n- Abnormal shedding (dysecdysis)\n- Discharge from eyes, nose, or mouth\n- Swollen limbs (a sign of metabolic bone disease)\n\n**Vet Care**:\n- Find a reptile-experienced veterinarian (not all vets treat reptiles).\n- Schedule a check-up when you first get your pet and annually thereafter.\n- Quarantine new reptiles for 30-60 days if you have other pets to prevent disease spread.\n\n**Cleaning**:\n- Spot-clean the enclosure daily (remove waste, uneaten food).\n- Deep clean the tank every 1-2 months with reptile-safe disinfectants. Rinse thoroughly.\n- Avoid using toxic chemicals or soaps.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Commitment and Legal Considerations\n- **Lifespan**: Many reptiles live decades. Be prepared for a long-term commitment.\n- **Cost**: Initial setup (tank, lights, heat) can cost $100-500\u002B, with ongoing costs for food, vet care, and supplies.\n- **Legality**: Check local laws\u2014some reptiles (like certain snakes or turtles) may be illegal to own or require permits.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- **Wrong Temperatures**: Too hot or cold can cause stress or death.\n- **No UVB**: Lack of UVB lighting leads to health issues like MBD.\n- **Overfeeding/Underfeeding**: Follow species-specific guidelines.\n- **Poor Hygiene**: Dirty enclosures lead to bacterial or fungal infections.\n- **Impulse Buying**: Don\u2019t buy a reptile without researching first\u2014many are abandoned due to unexpected care needs.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Learning Resources\n- **Books**: \u201CThe Leopard Gecko Manual\u201D or \u201CBearded Dragon Manual\u201D by Philippe de Vosjoli.\n- **Websites**: ReptiFiles.com, ReptileForum.com, or species-specific care sheets.\n- **Communities**: Join online forums or local reptile groups for advice and support.\n- **Veterinarians**: Consult a reptile vet for personalized guidance.\n\n---\n\nReptile care is a learning process, and mistakes can happen. Start with a beginner-friendly species, provide a proper environment, and stay observant of their behavior. With time, you\u2019ll become attuned to their needs and enjoy a unique bond with your scaly companion! If you have a specific reptile in mind, let me know, and I can tailor the advice further."
