    "ChatGPT": "Setting up a guinea pig cage in a small space is definitely possible with some thoughtful planning. Here are tips and a step-by-step guide to create a comfortable and functional environment for your guinea pig:\n\n### 1. Choose the Right Cage\n- **Minimum Size:** Aim for at least 7.5 square feet of floor space for one guinea pig (e.g., 30\u0022 x 36\u0022) or more if possible. Bigger is always better, but small spaces can work with smart design.\n- **Vertical Space:** Guinea pigs don\u2019t climb much, so focus on maximizing floor area rather than height.\n- **DIY Options:** Consider using a C\u0026C (Cubes and Coroplast) cage, which is customizable and efficient for small areas.\n\n### 2. Location\n- Place the cage in a quiet, draft-free area with indirect natural light.\n- Avoid places with temperature extremes (not near heaters or air conditioners).\n- Ensure easy access for cleaning and interaction.\n\n### 3. Cage Setup Essentials\n- **Bedding:** Use soft, absorbent bedding like paper-based or fleece liners (fleece is reusable and saves space since less bedding is needed).\n- **Hideouts:** Provide at least one hideout or small shelter for the guinea pig to feel secure. Opt for compact hideouts to save space.\n- **Food and Water:** \n   - Use a sturdy ceramic bowl for pellets and veggies.\n   - A water bottle that attaches to the side saves floor space.\n- **Toys and Chews:** Include chew toys to keep teeth healthy, but keep them minimal to avoid clutter.\n\n### 4. Optimize Space\n- **Multi-level Platforms?** Not necessary for guinea pigs, but a small, low ramp can create a bit more exploration space.\n- **Use Vertical Sides:** Attach water bottles or hay racks on cage sides to free up floor space.\n- **Keep it Tidy:** Regular cleaning keeps the small space comfortable and odor-free.\n\n### 5. Example Small Setup\n- Cage: 30\u0022 x 30\u0022 C\u0026C cage with coroplast bottom\n- Bedding: Fleece liner with absorbent layers underneath\n- Hideout: Small wooden or plastic hut in a corner\n- Food bowl and water bottle attached on opposite sides\n- Hay rack mounted on the cage wall\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Guinea pigs are social animals, so if space allows, keep at least two together; otherwise, ensure plenty of daily social interaction.\n- Rotate toys and change layout occasionally to keep your pet engaged.\n- Provide daily floor time outside the cage for exercise and mental stimulation.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also suggest specific products or provide a sketch for your setup!",
    "Grok": "Setting up a guinea pig cage in a small space can be a fun and rewarding project. Guinea pigs need enough room to roam, explore, and feel safe, even in a compact area. Here\u2019s a guide to help you create a comfortable and functional cage setup for your guinea pig in a limited space:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Choose the Right Cage Size\n- **Minimum Size**: Guinea pigs need a minimum of 7.5 square feet (for one guinea pig) or 10.5 square feet (for two) to thrive, as recommended by the Humane Society. Even in a small space, prioritize their need for room to move.\n- **Multi-Level Cages**: If floor space is limited, consider a cage with multiple levels to provide more area vertically. Ensure ramps are gentle (not too steep) and have solid surfaces for their delicate feet.\n- **C\u0026C Cages**: If store-bought cages are too big for your space, consider a modular C\u0026C (cubes and coroplast) cage. These are customizable and can be built to fit awkward or small spaces.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Location of the Cage\n- **Quiet and Safe Spot**: Place the cage in a quiet area away from loud noises, direct sunlight, drafts, and other pets. A corner of a room or a sturdy shelf can work well in a small space.\n- **Temperature**: Keep the cage in a spot with a consistent temperature (65-75\u00B0F or 18-24\u00B0C) to avoid heat or cold stress.\n- **Accessibility**: Ensure you can easily access the cage for cleaning and interaction without moving furniture or other items.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Essential Cage Components\nEven in a small space, include the following to meet your guinea pig\u2019s needs:\n- **Bedding**: Use a safe, absorbent bedding like fleece liners (with an absorbent layer underneath), aspen wood shavings, or paper-based bedding. Avoid pine or cedar shavings due to harmful fumes. Fleece liners are great for small spaces as they\u2019re reusable and reduce dust.\n- **Hideouts**: Provide at least one hideout per guinea pig (e.g., wooden houses, tunnels, or igloos) so they feel secure. Look for space-saving designs like corner hideys.\n- **Food and Water**: Use a heavy ceramic bowl or attachable hay rack for hay (their main food), a small bowl for pellets, and a water bottle attached to the side of the cage to save floor space.\n- **Toys and Enrichment**: Include chew toys, tunnels, or small balls for mental stimulation. Rotate toys weekly to keep things interesting without cluttering the space.\n- **Hay Area**: Designate a corner for hay using a hay rack or a small litter box to keep it contained and save space.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Maximize Vertical Space\n- **Lofts or Ramps**: Add a small loft area with a ramp for extra space to explore. Cover the ramp with a soft material like fleece for grip.\n- **Wall-Mounted Accessories**: Attach hay racks, water bottles, and even small shelves to the sides of the cage to free up floor space.\n- **Stackable Storage**: If the cage is on the floor, place lightweight storage (like fleece or toy bins) on top of the cage if it has a lid or cover.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Small Space Cage Ideas\n- **Under-Desk Setup**: Place the cage under a desk or table if it\u2019s a low-traffic area. Add a cover to reduce noise and stress.\n- **Corner Cage**: Use a triangular or L-shaped cage to fit snugly into a corner, maximizing floor space in tight rooms.\n- **DIY Custom Cage**: Build a narrow, tall C\u0026C cage with grids to fit along a wall or in a nook. Use coroplast or a plastic base to create a waterproof bottom.\n- **Repurposed Furniture**: Convert a small bookshelf or unused dresser into a guinea pig habitat by removing shelves or adding levels. Ensure proper ventilation and safety (no sharp edges or toxic paint).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Cleaning and Maintenance in a Small Space\n- **Spot Cleaning**: Clean the cage daily by removing soiled bedding and droppings to keep odors at bay, especially in a small room.\n- **Odor Control**: Use odor-neutralizing bedding or place a small air purifier nearby if ventilation is limited.\n- **Compact Storage**: Keep cleaning supplies and extra bedding in stackable bins or under the cage to save space.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Exercise Outside the Cage\nSince the cage space may be limited, ensure your guinea pig gets daily out-of-cage time to stretch and explore.\n- **Floor Time**: Set up a safe, enclosed playpen area (even a small one) with a blanket or mat for them to run around on.\n- **Pet-Proof Small Area**: Clear a small section of your room (block cords, holes, etc.) for supervised playtime.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Budget-Friendly Tips for Small Spaces\n- Use household items like cardboard boxes (for temporary hideouts) or small plastic bins (for hay or litter areas) to save money and space.\n- Shop for compact accessories online or at pet stores that cater to small animals, focusing on multi-use items (e.g., a hideout that doubles as a chew toy).\n\n---\n\n### Sample Small-Space Setup (for a 2x3 C\u0026C Cage, ~7.5 sq ft)\n- **Base**: Coroplast tray with fleece liner bedding.\n- **Corner 1**: Small wooden hideout.\n- **Corner 2**: Hay rack attached to the wall with a small litter box underneath for mess control.\n- **Side**: Water bottle and small pellet bowl attached or placed near the edge.\n- **Center**: Low tunnel or chew toy for enrichment.\n- **Above**: Add a small loft (1x2 grid size) with a fleece-covered ramp for extra space.\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on vertical space, minimal but essential accessories, and a regular cleaning routine, you can create a cozy, functional home for your guinea pig even in a small area. Remember to spend time interacting with them daily, as companionship is just as important as their physical environment! If you have specific dimensions or constraints, let me know, and I can tailor suggestions further.",
    "Mistral": "Setting up a guinea pig cage in a small space requires careful planning to ensure your pet has enough room to move around, play, and stay healthy. Here are some tips for creating a comfortable and safe environment for your guinea pig in a limited space:\n\n### 1. **Choose the Right Cage**\n- **Size**: The minimum recommended size for a guinea pig cage is 7.5 square feet (about 2.3 square meters) for one guinea pig, but larger is always better.
