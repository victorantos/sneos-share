    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive explanation of API error codes, broken down by their categories (client vs. server errors) and including common patterns and best practices.\n\n### The Big Picture: HTTP Status Code Classes\n\nAPI error codes are primarily based on HTTP status codes. The first digit of the code defines its class:\n\n*   **1xx (Informational):** The request was received, continuing process. (Rarely used in APIs).\n*   **2xx (Success):** The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n    *   \u0060200 OK\u0060 (The standard success)\n    *   \u0060201 Created\u0060 (Success, a new resource was created)\n*   **3xx (Redirection):** Further action needs to be taken to complete the request. (Also less common in pure REST APIs).\n*   **4xx (Client Error):** **The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.** This is the user\u0027s/client\u0027s fault.\n*   **5xx (Server Error):** **The server failed to fulfill a valid request.** This is the API server\u0027s fault.\n\n---\n\n### 4xx Client Errors (You Did Something Wrong)\n\nThese mean the client application made an invalid request. The client should not retry the request without modifications.\n\n| Code | Name | Meaning \u0026 Common Causes | Example Scenario |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **400** | **Bad Request** | The server cannot process the request due to something perceived as a client error. A generic catch-all. | Malformed JSON in the request body, missing a required field, invalid data type (e.g., sending a string for a number field). |\n| **401** | **Unauthorized** | Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided. The user isn\u0027t who they claim to be. | Invalid, missing, or expired API key / JWT token. |\n| **403** | **Forbidden** | The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. The user is authenticated but not allowed to do this. | A user trying to delete another user\u0027s data; an API key lacking the required permissions/scopes. |\n| **404** | **Not Found** | The requested resource could not be found on the server. | Requesting a user with an ID that doesn\u0027t exist (\u0060/users/99999\u0060); an incorrect or misspelled endpoint URL. |\n| **405** | **Method Not Allowed** | The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) is not supported for the requested resource. | Sending a \u0060POST\u0060 request to an endpoint that only allows \u0060GET\u0060. |\n| **429** | **Too Many Requests** | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\u0022rate limiting\u0022). | The client exceeds the API\u0027s rate limit (e.g., 1000 requests per hour). The response should include headers like \u0060Retry-After\u0060 to indicate when to try again. |\n| **422** | **Unprocessable Entity** | The request was well-formed but contains semantic errors. Often used for validation errors. | A \u0060POST\u0060 request to create a user with an invalid email format or a password that\u0027s too short. More specific than \u0060400\u0060. |\n\n---\n\n### 5xx Server Errors (The API Did Something Wrong)\n\nThese mean the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request. The client **can** retry the request later, preferably with exponential backoff.\n\n| Code | Name | Meaning \u0026 Common Causes | Example Scenario |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **500** | **Internal Server Error** | A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition. A catch-all for unhandled exceptions. | A bug in the API\u0027s code, a database connection suddenly failing, an uncaught exception. |\n| **502** | **Bad Gateway** | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server. | A load balancer or reverse proxy (like Nginx) cannot get a valid response from the backend application server. |\n| **503** | **Service Unavailable** | The server is temporarily unable to handle the request, usually due to being down for maintenance or being overloaded. | The server is intentionally taken down for a deployment; a sudden traffic spike overwhelms the server. The response should include a \u0060Retry-After\u0060 header if possible. |\n| **504** | **Gateway Timeout** | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server. | A database query or a call to an external service is taking too long and times out from the perspective of the proxy. |\n\n---\n\n### Beyond the Status Code: The Error Response Body\n\nA good API doesn\u0027t just return a status code; it returns a helpful body explaining the error in a consistent format.\n\n**Example of a Bad Error Response:**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060http\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nBad Request\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Example of a Good Error Response:**\n\u0060\u0060\u0060http\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \u0022error\u0022: {\n    \u0022code\u0022: \u0022VALIDATION_ERROR\u0022,\n    \u0022message\u0022: \u0022The request body failed validation.\u0022,\n    \u0022details\u0022: [\n      {\n        \u0022field\u0022: \u0022email\u0022,\n        \u0022message\u0022: \u0022The email format is invalid.\u0022\n      },\n      {\n        \u0022field\u0022: \u0022password\u0022,\n        \u0022message\u0022: \u0022The password must be at least 8 characters.\u0022\n      }\n    ],\n    \u0022trace_id\u0022: \u0022req_abc123\u0022 // For support/debugging\n  }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Common Fields in an Error Response Body:\n\n*   **\u0060code\u0060**: A machine-readable, API-specific error code (e.g., \u0060invalid_token\u0060, \u0060insufficient_funds\u0060). More specific than the HTTP status code.\n*   **\u0060message\u0060**: A short, human-readable message summarizing the error.\n*   **\u0060details\u0060 / \u0060errors\u0060**: An array or object providing more specific information, often about validation errors on specific fields.\n*   **\u0060trace_id\u0060 / \u0060request_id\u0060**: A unique identifier for the request, invaluable for debugging when you contact the API\u0027s support team.\n\n---\n\n### Best Practices for Handling API Errors (As a Developer)\n\n1.  **Always Check the Status Code:** Don\u0027t assume a response is successful. Your code should handle non-2xx statuses.\n2.  **Read the Response Body:** The body contains crucial details about what went wrong. Log it for debugging.\n3.  **Handle 4xx Errors Gracefully:** Inform the user appropriately. For a \u0060429\u0060, implement a retry mechanism with a delay.\n4.  **Handle 5xx Errors with Retries:** For \u00605xx\u0060 errors (except \u0060501\u0060), it\u0027s often safe to retry the request after a short delay. Use an **exponential backoff** strategy to avoid overwhelming the server.\n5.  **Use Idempotency Keys:** For \u0060POST\u0060 and other non-idempotent requests, use idempotency keys to safely retry requests without risking duplicate actions (e.g., charging a card twice).\n\n### Best Practices for Designing APIs (As an API Provider)\n\n1.  **Be Consistent:** Use a standard error format across all your endpoints.\n2.  **Use the Correct Status Codes:** Don\u0027t just return \u0060400\u0060 for everything. Use \u0060401\u0060, \u0060403\u0060, \u0060404\u0060, and \u0060422\u0060 to give clear signals to the client.\n3.  **Be Helpful:** Provide a clear \u0060message\u0060 and a machine-readable \u0060code\u0060. For validation errors, use a \u0060details\u0060 array to point to the problematic fields.\n4.  **Don\u0027t Leak Sensitive Information:** A \u0060500\u0060 error should never reveal stack traces, database connection strings, or server paths to the client in a production environment. Use a generic message and a \u0060trace_id\u0060 for internal tracking.\n5.  **Document Your Errors:** Your API documentation should list the possible HTTP status codes and error body formats for each endpoint.",
    "Gemini": "API error codes are a crucial part of how APIs communicate problems to the client (the application or developer using the API). They provide structured information about why a request failed, allowing developers to diagnose and fix issues. Understanding these error codes is essential for building reliable and robust applications that interact with APIs.\n\nHere\u0027s a breakdown of API error codes, covering common aspects and best practices:\n\n**1.  What are API Error Codes?**\n\n*   **Purpose:**  API error codes are numeric or alphanumeric codes used to signal that a request to an API has failed. They are usually accompanied by an error message that provides more context.\n*   **Part of the Response:**  Error codes are typically returned in the HTTP response from the API server.  They are part of the response body (usually in JSON or XML format) or sometimes within the HTTP status code.\n*   **Machine-Readable:** Designed to be easily parsed and understood by machines (the client application). This allows for automated error handling and retry logic.\n*   **Human-Readable (Optional):**  Often, error codes are accompanied by human-readable error messages that are easier for developers to understand.\n*   **Consistency:** A well-designed API should use a consistent and predictable error coding scheme.\n\n**2.  Common Types of Error Codes:**\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** While not strictly *API-specific* error codes, HTTP status codes form the foundation of error reporting in web APIs. They are standardized and provide a general classification of the error.\n\n    *   **2xx (Success):**  Indicates that the request was successful.  (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created)\n    *   **3xx (Redirection):** Indicates that further action needs to be taken by the client, usually involving a redirection. (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found)\n    *   **4xx (Client Error):** Indicates that the request contained an error.  This is a common area for APIs to provide more specific error information.  Examples:\n        *   **400 Bad Request:**  Generic error indicating the request was malformed.  The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n        *   **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.  The client needs to authenticate itself to get the requested response.  Typically, a \u0060WWW-Authenticate\u0060 header is included in the response.\n        *   **403 Forbidden:**  The client does not have permission to access the requested resource, regardless of authentication.  Authentication may be successful, but the user is not authorized.\n        *   **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.\n        *   **405 Method Not Allowed:** The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource identified by the request URI.  For example, trying to \u0060POST\u0060 to an endpoint that only accepts \u0060GET\u0060 requests.\n        *   **409 Conflict:** The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.  Often occurs during \u0060PUT\u0060 requests when the resource has been modified by another client.\n        *   **422 Unprocessable Entity:** The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. This is often used for validation errors.\n        *   **429 Too Many Requests:** The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\u0022rate limiting\u0022).\n    *   **5xx (Server Error):** Indicates that the server encountered an error while processing the request.  These errors are typically *not* the fault of the client.\n        *   **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.\n        *   **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.\n        *   **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unavailable (e.g., due to overload or maintenance).  Generally, a temporary condition.\n        *   **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.\n\n*   **Application-Specific Error Codes:**  APIs often define their own error codes *in addition* to HTTP status codes. These codes provide more detailed information specific to the API\u0027s domain.\n\n    *   **Example:**  An e-commerce API might have error codes like \u0060PRODUCT_NOT_IN_STOCK\u0060, \u0060INVALID_SHIPPING_ADDRESS\u0060, or \u0060PAYMENT_FAILED\u0060.\n    *   **Format:**  These codes can be numeric (e.g., \u00601001\u0060, \u00601002\u0060), alphanumeric (e.g., \u0060ERR-INV-ADDR\u0060, \u0060ITEM-OUT-OF-STOCK\u0060), or strings (e.g., \u0060\u0022invalid_email\u0022\u0060, \u0060\u0022missing_parameter\u0022\u0060).\n    *   **JSON Structure:** Typically included in the JSON response body, often within an \u0022error\u0022 object or array. For example:\n\n        \u0060\u0060\u0060json\n        {\n          \u0022error\u0022: {\n            \u0022code\u0022: \u0022INVALID_PARAMETER\u0022,\n            \u0022message\u0022: \u0022The \u0027amount\u0027 parameter must be a positive number.\u0022,\n            \u0022field\u0022: \u0022amount\u0022\n          }\n        }\n        \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**3. Key Components of a Good Error Response:**\n\nA well-structured error response should include the following:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code:**  The standard HTTP status code (e.g., 400, 401, 500) to indicate the general category of error.  *Always* include an appropriate HTTP status code.\n*   **Error Code:**  A specific, API-defined code that identifies the particular error (e.g., \u0060USER_NOT_FOUND\u0060, \u0060INVALID_CREDENTIALS\u0060). This allows clients to programmatically handle specific errors.\n*   **Error Message:**  A human-readable message that describes the error.  This should be clear and concise, helping developers understand what went wrong. *Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.*\n*   **Error Details (Optional):**  Additional information that can help diagnose the error. This might include:\n    *   **Field:**  The specific field that caused the error (e.g., if validation failed).\n    *   **Value:**  The invalid value that was provided.\n    *   **Reason:**  More detailed explanation of why the error occurred.\n    *   **Stack Trace (Caution!):**  In development environments, a stack trace can be useful, but *never* expose stack traces in production environments due to security concerns.\n*   **Links (Optional):**  Links to relevant documentation or resources that can help developers resolve the error.  This could be a link to the API\u0027s error code documentation.\n\n**Example of a Full Error Response (JSON):**\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n  \u0022status\u0022: 400,\n  \u0022error\u0022: {\n    \u0022code\u0022: \u0022INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT\u0022,\n    \u0022message\u0022: \u0022The email address is not in a valid format.\u0022,\n    \u0022field\u0022: \u0022email\u0022,\n    \u0022value\u0022: \u0022invalid-email\u0022,\n    \u0022details\u0022: \u0022The email address must contain an \u0027@\u0027 symbol and a valid domain.\u0022\n  },\n  \u0022timestamp\u0022: \u00222023-10-27T10:30:00Z\u0022,\n  \u0022path\u0022: \u0022/api/users\u0022\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**4. Best Practices for Designing Error Codes:**\n\n*   **Be Specific:** Use specific error codes that clearly identify the problem. Avoid generic error codes like \u0022ERROR\u0022 or \u0022UNKNOWN_ERROR\u0022 as much as possible.\n*   **Be Consistent:**  Use a consistent naming convention for error codes (e.g., all uppercase with underscores).  Maintain a consistent structure for your error responses.\n*   **Document Your Error Codes:**  Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for all error codes, including their meaning, possible causes, and how to resolve them. This is *critical* for developer adoption and ease of use.\n*   **Use HTTP Status Codes Appropriately:**  Choose the HTTP status code that best reflects the *general* nature of the error.  The API-specific error code provides the detailed explanation.\n*   **Don\u0027t Expose Sensitive Information:** Avoid including sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, internal server details) in error messages.  This is a security risk.\n*   **Internationalization (i18n):**  Consider internationalizing your error messages so they can be displayed in the user\u0027s preferred language.\n*   **Versioning:** As your API evolves, you may need to add or modify error codes.  Use API versioning to ensure that clients are not broken by these changes.\n*   **Logging:** Log all errors on the server-side, including the error code, error message, and any relevant context.  This is essential for debugging and monitoring your API.\n*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your API\u0027s error handling to ensure that it returns the correct error codes and messages for different scenarios.\n*   **Consider an Error Taxonomy:**  Develop a hierarchy of error codes to group related errors together.  This can make it easier to find the right error code.\n*   **Graceful Degradation:**  In cases where the API can\u0027t fully complete a request, consider providing a partial response with an error code indicating what failed.  This can be better than simply returning an error.\n*   **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):**  In hypermedia APIs, error responses can include links to resources that can help the client resolve the error.  For example, a link to a form that the user can use to correct the invalid data.\n\n**5.  How to Handle API Errors on the Client-Side:**\n\n*   **Check the HTTP Status Code:**  Always check the HTTP status code of the response.  If it\u0027s in the 4xx or 5xx range, an error has occurred.\n*   **Parse the Error Response:**  Parse the JSON or XML response body to extract the error code and error message.\n*   **Implement Error Handling Logic:**  Based on the error code, implement specific error handling logic. This might involve:\n    *   Displaying an error message to the user.\n    *   Retrying the request (with appropriate backoff).\n    *   Logging the error.\n    *   Redirecting the user to a different page.\n    *   Disabling certain functionality.\n*   **Idempotency (for Retry Logic):** If you\u0027re retrying requests, ensure that the API endpoints are idempotent.  This means that retrying the same request multiple times has the same effect as making the request once.  Use techniques like unique request IDs to ensure idempotency.\n*   **User-Friendly Messages:** Present errors to the user in a way that is clear, concise, and helpful.  Avoid technical jargon.\n\n**Example (JavaScript using \u0060fetch\u0060):**\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\nfetch(\u0027/api/resource\u0027, {\n  method: \u0027POST\u0027,\n  body: JSON.stringify({ data: \u0027invalid\u0027 })\n})\n.then(response =\u003E {\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    return response.json().then(errorData =\u003E {\n      throw new Error(\u0060${response.status} - ${errorData.error.code}: ${errorData.error.message}\u0060);\n    });\n  }\n  return response.json();\n})\n.then(data =\u003E {\n  console.log(\u0027Success:\u0027, data);\n})\n.catch(error =\u003E {\n  console.error(\u0027Error:\u0027, error.message);\n  // Display a user-friendly error message.\n  alert(\u0027An error occurred: \u0027 \u002B error.message);\n});\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**In summary, well-defined and consistently implemented API error codes are critical for the usability, reliability, and maintainability of your API.  They provide valuable information to clients, enabling them to handle errors gracefully and build robust applications.**\n"
