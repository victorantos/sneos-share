    "ChatGPT": "Error calling OpenAI API.",
    "Gemini": "Google Assistant can interact with banking in a few different ways, depending on the bank and the features they\u0027ve enabled. Here\u0027s a breakdown of what\u0027s generally possible and things to consider:\n\n**Common Functionality:**\n\n*   **Balance Inquiries:** You can typically ask Google Assistant to check your account balances. For example, you could say, \u0022Hey Google, what\u0027s my checking account balance?\u0022\n*   **Transaction History:** Some banks allow you to retrieve recent transactions. You might ask, \u0022Hey Google, show me my last five transactions.\u0022\n*   **Money Transfers:** With some banks, you can transfer money between your accounts. For example, \u0022Hey Google, transfer $50 from savings to checking.\u0022\n*   **Bill Payments:** Some integrations allow you to pay bills through Google Assistant. You could say, \u0022Hey Google, pay my electric bill.\u0022\n*   **Finding ATMs:** You can ask Google Assistant to find nearby ATMs. For example, \u0022Hey Google, find the nearest [Bank Name] ATM.\u0022\n*   **Sending money to friends/family:** Using Google Pay, you can send money to contacts.  \u0022Hey Google, send [amount] to [contact name] using Google Pay.\u0022\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Bank Compatibility:** Not all banks have integrated with Google Assistant. You\u0027ll need to check if your bank supports this feature.  Look on your bank\u0027s website or app for information about Google Assistant integration.\n*   **Setup and Linking:**  You\u0027ll usually need to link your bank account to Google Assistant through a secure authentication process. This typically involves logging into your bank account within the Google Assistant app or a secure browser window.\n*   **Security:** Security is paramount. Google uses encryption and security measures to protect your financial information. However, it\u0027s important to:\n    *   **Use strong passwords:** For both your Google account and your bank account.\n    *   **Enable voice match:** To prevent unauthorized access to your account.\n    *   **Regularly review your account activity:** To ensure no unauthorized transactions have occurred.\n*   **Voice Commands:**  Be precise with your voice commands to avoid errors or unintended transactions.\n*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Whenever possible, enable 2FA on both your Google and bank accounts for an added layer of security.\n\n**How to Get Started:**\n\n1.  **Check Bank Compatibility:** Visit your bank\u0027s website or contact their customer service to see if they offer Google Assistant integration.\n2.  **Open Google Assistant:** Open the Google Assistant app on your phone or use a Google Home device.\n3.  **Find Banking Options (If Available):**\n    *   **Explore Assistant Settings:** Look for a \u0022Services\u0022 or \u0022Explore\u0022 section within the Google Assistant settings. You might find a banking category or your specific bank listed there.\n    *   **Use Voice Commands:** Try saying, \u0022Hey Google, talk to [Bank Name].\u0022 If the bank has an Action, it will be triggered.\n4.  **Follow the Setup Instructions:** If your bank is supported, follow the on-screen instructions to link your account. This typically involves logging in to your bank account through a secure browser window and granting Google Assistant permission to access certain information.\n5.  **Test Commands:** Once linked, try some basic commands like checking your balance.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Voice Commands:** Ensure you\u0027re using the correct commands and that Google Assistant is understanding you properly.\n*   **Account Not Linked:** Double-check that your bank account is properly linked to Google Assistant.\n*   **Permissions Issues:** Verify that Google Assistant has the necessary permissions to access your banking information.\n*   **Bank App Updates:** Make sure your bank\u0027s mobile app is up to date.\n*   **Google Assistant App Updates:** Ensure your Google Assistant app is the latest version.\n\n**Privacy Considerations:**\n\n*   Review Google\u0027s and your bank\u0027s privacy policies to understand how your data is being used and protected.\n*   You can review and delete your Google Assistant voice activity in your Google account settings.\n\nIn summary, Google Assistant can offer convenient banking features, but it\u0027s crucial to prioritize security and check compatibility with your specific bank. Always verify transactions and monitor your accounts regularly for any suspicious activity.\n",
    "Mistral": "Google Assistant can be a helpful tool for managing various aspects of your banking and financial life.
