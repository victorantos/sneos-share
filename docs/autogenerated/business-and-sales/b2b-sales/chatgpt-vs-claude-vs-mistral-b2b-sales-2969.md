    "Mistral": "Sales qualification criteria help small teams focus on high-potential leads and opportunities, ensuring they use their resources effectively. Here are some key qualification criteria suitable for small teams:\n\n1. **BANT (Budget, Authority, Needs, Timeline):**\n   - **Budget**: Does the prospect have a budget allocated for your product/service?\n   - **Authority**: Is the contact person an influencer or decision-maker?\n   - **Needs**: Does the prospect have a need or pain point that your product/service can address?\n   - **Timeline**: What is the prospect\u0027s timeline for implementation or purchase?\n\n2. **GPCT (Goals, Plans, Challenges, Timeline):**\n   - **Goals**: What are the prospect\u0027s business goals?\n   - **Plans**: What plans do they have in place to achieve these goals?\n   - **Challenges**: What challenges are they facing that your product/service can solve?\n   - **Timeline**: What is their timeline for addressing these challenges?\n\n3. **Additional Criteria:**\n   - **Fit**: Does the prospect fit your ideal customer profile (ICP) in terms of industry, size, location, etc.?\n   - **Engagement**: Has the prospect engaged with your content, website, or emails?\n   - **Pain Points**: Have they clearly defined and communicated their pain points?\n   - **Competition**: Are they considering a competitor\u0027s product/service?\n   - **Current Solution**: What is their current solution, and are they satisfied with it?\n\n4. **Lead Scoring**: Implement a lead scoring system based on the above criteria to prioritize leads. This approach can help small teams focus on the most promising opportunities.\n\n5. **Disqualification Criteria**: Clearly define what makes a lead unqualified, such as:\n   - No budget or low budget\n   - No decision-making authority\n   - No defined needs or pain points\n   - Unrealistic timeline\n   - Poor fit with your ICP\n\n6. **Regular Review**: Small teams should regularly review and update their qualification criteria to ensure they remain relevant and effective.\n\nBy consistently applying these qualification criteria, small teams can maximize their sales efforts and increase the likelihood of closing deals."
