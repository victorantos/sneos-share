    "DeepSeek": "Of course. This is a comprehensive legal guide to forming and maintaining a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the United States.\n\n***\n\n**Disclaimer:** This guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal or tax advice. The process is complex and state-specific. You are strongly encouraged to consult with a qualified attorney and a CPA who specialize in non-profit law to guide you through this process.\n\n---\n\n### **The Complete Non-Profit Legal Guide: Formation \u0026 Compliance**\n\nThis guide is broken down into two main parts:\n1.  **Part 1: Formation** - The steps to legally create and obtain 501(c)(3) status.\n2.  **Part 2: Compliance** - The ongoing rules to maintain your tax-exempt status and avoid penalties.\n\n---\n\n## **Part 1: Forming Your 501(c)(3) Non-Profit**\n\nThis is a multi-stage process that involves state and federal governments.\n\n### **Stage 1: The Pre-Foundation (Planning \u0026 Structure)**\n\nBefore you file any paperwork, you must lay the proper groundwork.\n\n1.  **Define Your Charitable Purpose:**\n    Your organization\u0027s mission **must** fall under one of the IRS\u0027s approved categories:\n    *   Charitable\n    *   Religious\n    *   Educational\n    *   Scientific\n    *   Literary\n    *   Testing for public safety\n    *   Fostering national/international amateur sports competition\n    *   Preventing cruelty to children or animals\n    Your governing documents must clearly state this purpose.\n\n2.  **Choose a Name:**\n    *   Conduct a name search in your state of incorporation to ensure it\u0027s unique and available.\n    *   Ensure the name is not too similar to an existing business or trademark.\n    *   Consider a name that clearly reflects your mission.\n\n3.  **Assemble Your Initial Directors:**\n    *   You need at least three people for a well-rounded board. Avoid a board composed entirely of family members or people from the same household.\n    *   Your initial board will serve until the first election, as defined in your bylaws.\n\n4.  **Draft Your Governing Documents:**\n    *   **Bylaws:** These are the internal \u0022rules of the road\u0022 for your organization. They define:\n        *   The roles and responsibilities of directors and officers.\n        *   How meetings are conducted (quorum, voting).\n        *   Committee structures.\n        *   Membership provisions (if you will have members).\n        *   Conflict of interest policy procedures.\n    *   **Conflict of Interest Policy:** This is a **critical** document. It requires directors, officers, and key employees to disclose any financial interests that might conflict with the organization\u0027s duties. The IRS looks for this in your application.\n\n### **Stage 2: State-Level Formation**\n\nYou create the legal entity under state law.\n\n1.  **Incorporate in Your State:**\n    *   File **Articles of Incorporation** with the appropriate state agency (usually the Secretary of State).\n    *   The Articles *must* include specific **IRS tax-exemption language**. This is non-negotiable. The two key clauses are:\n        *   **Purpose Clause:** Stating the organization is formed for one of the 501(c)(3) purposes listed above.\n        *   **Dissolution Clause:** Stating that upon dissolution, the organization\u0027s assets will be distributed for an exempt purpose or to another 501(c)(3), the federal government, or a state or local government for a public purpose. **This ensures the assets remain dedicated to a charitable mission.**\n\n2.  **Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number):**\n    *   Apply for an EIN from the IRS (Form SS-4). This is free and can be done online. It\u0027s like a social security number for your organization and is required to open bank accounts and hire employees.\n\n3.  **Hold Your First Board Meeting \u0026 Adopt Bylaws:**\n    *   The initial board of directors should hold an organizational meeting.\n    *   Key actions at this meeting include:\n        *   Adopting the Bylaws and Conflict of Interest Policy.\n        *   Appointing officers (President, Secretary, Treasurer).\n        *   Approving the opening of a bank account.\n        *   Setting the accounting period (fiscal year).\n        *   Authorizing the filing of the 501(c)(3) application.\n\n### **Stage 3: Federal Tax-Exemption Application**\n\nThis is the most complex part of the process.\n\n1.  **Complete and File IRS Form 1023 Series:**\n    *   **Form 1023:** The long-form application. Used by most organizations with anticipated annual gross receipts exceeding $50,000. It is detailed and requires significant financial projections and narrative.\n    *   **Form 1023-EZ:** A streamlined application. Only available to organizations projecting gross receipts of \u2264$50,000 in the next three years and with assets of \u2264$250,000. It is much simpler and filed online, but not all organizations qualify.\n    *   **Form 1024-A:** For organizations seeking 501(c)(4) status (social welfare orgs), not (c)(3).\n\n2.  **What Form 1023 Requires:**\n    *   A detailed narrative of your activities.\n    *   Financial data (budgets, balance sheets).\n    *   Copies of your Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\n    *   Information about your board of directors, officers, and key employees.\n    *   A statement of your fundraising practices.\n    *   A user fee (which varies; check the IRS website for the current amount).\n\n3.  **The IRS Determination:**\n    *   The IRS review can take from 3 to 12 months (longer for complex applications).\n    *   If approved, you will receive a **Determination Letter** stating that you are recognized as a 501(c)(3) public charity.\n    *   Your tax-exemption is effective from the \u0022date of formation\u0022 (the postmark date of your Articles of Incorporation), provided you file Form 1023 within 27 months.\n\n### **Stage 4: Post-Formation State \u0026 Local Requirements**\n\n1.  **State Tax Exemption:** You may need to apply separately for exemption from state income, sales, and property taxes. The IRS determination letter is key evidence for these applications.\n2.  **Charitable Solicitation Registration:** If you plan to raise funds from the public, most states require you to register *before* you solicit donations. This is a critical and often overlooked step.\n3.  **Business Licenses:** Obtain any required local business licenses or permits.\n4.  **Open a Bank Account:** Use your EIN to open a dedicated business bank account. **Never commingle personal and organizational funds.**\n\n---\n\n## **Part 2: Ongoing Compliance for 501(c)(3) Organizations**\n\nMaintaining your status is an active, ongoing responsibility.\n\n### **1. Corporate Governance**\n\n*   **Board Responsibilities:** Your board must be active and engaged in governance, not just a \u0022rubber stamp.\u0022 They have a **fiduciary duty** (Duty of Care, Duty of Loyalty, Duty of Obedience) to the organization.\n*   **Meetings:** Hold regular board meetings (at least annually, but quarterly is better) and document them with **meeting minutes**. Minutes are your legal record of important decisions.\n*   **Avoiding Private Inurement:** This is the cardinal rule. **No part of the organization\u0027s net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.** This means you cannot unfairly benefit insiders (directors, officers, key employees). Reasonable compensation for services is allowed, but it must be documented and justified as \u0022reasonable.\u0022\n\n### **2. Federal Annual Filing (Form 990 Series)**\n\n**You must file a version of the Form 990 every year, even if you have no income.** Failure to file for three consecutive years will result in an automatic revocation of your tax-exempt status.\n\n*   **Form 990-N (e-Postcard):** For organizations with gross receipts \u2264 $50,000.\n*   **Form 990-EZ:** For organizations with gross receipts \u003C $200,000 and total assets \u003C $500,000.\n*   **Form 990 (Long Form):** For organizations with gross receipts \u2265 $200,000 or total assets \u2265 $500,000.\n*   **Form 990-T:** If you have **Unrelated Business Income (UBI)** of $1,000 or more, you must file this form and may owe tax. UBI is income from a trade or business that is regularly carried on and is not substantially related to your exempt purpose (e.g., a museum running an unrelated restaurant).\n\n### **3. Lobbying and Political Activity**\n\nThis is a highly regulated area. Missteps can lead to penalties or revocation.\n\n*   **Political Campaign Activity: ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED.**\n    *   You cannot endorse or oppose candidates for public office.\n    *   You cannot donate to political campaigns.\n    *   You cannot engage in partisan political activities.\n*   **Lobbying (Influencing Legislation):** **Permitted, but limited.**\n    *   You can educate legislators on issues.\n    *   There are two tests for lobbying limits: the \u0022insubstantial part\u0022 test or the more precise **501(h) election**, which provides clear spending limits. Making the 501(h) election is generally recommended.\n\n### **4. State \u0026 Local Compliance**\n\n*   **Annual State Reports:** Most states require an annual report (and fee) to the Secretary of State to keep your corporation in \u0022good standing.\u0022\n*   **Charitable Solicitation Renewals:** If you are registered to fundraise, you must",
    "Grok": "Starting and maintaining a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in the United States involves a series of legal, administrative, and ongoing compliance steps. A 501(c)(3) designation refers to a specific tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, typically granted to organizations with charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, or similar purposes. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the formation process and ongoing compliance requirements for a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. \n\nWhile this guide is thorough, it is not a substitute for professional legal or accounting advice. Consult with an attorney, accountant, or nonprofit specialist for guidance tailored to your specific situation and state laws.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: Formation of a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization\n\n#### 1. Understand the Purpose and Eligibility for 501(c)(3) Status\n- **Purpose**: 501(c)(3) status is reserved for organizations that operate for charitable, educational, religious, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, or preventing cruelty to children or animals. The organization must serve a public benefit, not private interests.\n- **Prohibited Activities**: 501(c)(3) organizations are prohibited from:\n  - Engaging in political campaign activities (e.g., endorsing candidates).\n  - Excessive lobbying (though some lobbying is allowed if it does not constitute a substantial part of activities).\n  - Providing private benefits to individuals or insiders (e.g., excessive compensation to founders or board members).\n- **Public Charity vs. Private Foundation**: Most 501(c)(3) organizations aim to be classified as public charities (funded by the general public, government grants, or program revenue) rather than private foundations (typically funded by a single source, like a family or corporation, and subject to stricter rules).\n\n#### 2. Choose a Name for Your Nonprofit\n- Select a unique name that reflects your mission and complies with state naming rules.\n- Check name availability through your state\u2019s business registry (often the Secretary of State\u2019s website).\n- Ensure the name does not infringe on trademarks by searching the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database.\n- Reserve the name if required by your state.\n\n#### 3. Form a Board of Directors\n- Appoint a board of directors (or trustees) to oversee the organization. Most states require at least 3 unrelated individuals (check your state\u2019s minimum).\n- Board members should be committed to the mission, have no conflicts of interest, and ideally bring diverse skills (e.g., legal, financial, or fundraising expertise).\n- Establish roles such as president, secretary, and treasurer.\n\n#### 4. Draft Bylaws\n- Bylaws are the internal rules governing your nonprofit\u2019s operations, including:\n  - Board structure and responsibilities.\n  - Meeting frequency and voting procedures.\n  - Conflict of interest policies.\n  - Amendment processes.\n- Ensure bylaws comply with state law and IRS requirements (e.g., include a dissolution clause stating that assets will be distributed to another 501(c)(3) upon closure).\n\n#### 5. Incorporate at the State Level\n- File Articles of Incorporation (or a similar document) with your state\u2019s Secretary of State or equivalent agency. This legally establishes your nonprofit as a corporation.\n- Include required provisions in the Articles of Incorporation, such as:\n  - The nonprofit\u2019s name and purpose (must align with 501(c)(3) eligible purposes).\n  - A statement that the organization will not engage in prohibited activities (e.g., political campaigning).\n  - A dissolution clause for asset distribution.\n- Pay the state filing fee (varies by state, typically $25\u2013$100).\n- Appoint a registered agent (a person or entity to receive legal documents on behalf of the nonprofit).\n\n#### 6. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)\n- Apply for an EIN (also called a Federal Tax ID Number) from the IRS. This is required for tax filings, banking, and applying for 501(c)(3) status.\n- Apply online at the IRS website (free) or via Form SS-4 by mail or fax.\n\n#### 7. Apply for 501(c)(3) Federal Tax-Exempt Status\n- **Choose the Appropriate Form**:\n  - **Form 1023-EZ**: A streamlined application for smaller organizations expecting annual gross receipts of $50,000 or less and assets of $250,000 or less. Filing fee is $275 (as of 2023).\n  - **Form 1023**: The standard, more detailed application for larger organizations or those not eligible for Form 1023-EZ. Filing fee is $600 (as of 2023).\n- **Required Information for Form 1023/1023-EZ**:\n  - Organizational details (name, EIN, purpose, activities).\n  - Financial data (budget projections for the next 3 years).\n  - Governing documents (Articles of Incorporation, bylaws).\n  - Description of programs and how they fulfill a 501(c)(3) purpose.\n  - Conflict of interest policy.\n- **Submit Supporting Documents**:\n  - Articles of Incorporation (with state approval stamp).\n  - Bylaws.\n  - Any contracts or agreements (if applicable).\n- **Timeline**: Approval for Form 1023-EZ can take 2\u20134 weeks; Form 1023 may take 3\u20136 months or longer if the IRS requests additional information.\n- Upon approval, the IRS will issue a determination letter confirming your 501(c)(3) status.\n\n#### 8. Register for State Tax Exemptions and Charitable Solicitation\n- Apply for state tax exemptions (e.g., income tax, sales tax) if available in your state. Requirements vary by state.\n- Register for charitable solicitation if your nonprofit will fundraise. Many states require registration before soliciting donations, often through the Attorney General\u2019s office or a similar agency.\n\n#### 9. Open a Bank Account and Set Up Accounting\n- Open a business bank account in the nonprofit\u2019s name using the EIN and incorporation documents.\n- Establish an accounting system to track income, expenses, and donations. Consider using nonprofit-specific software like QuickBooks for Nonprofits.\n- Maintain separate finances from personal accounts to avoid commingling funds.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Ongoing Compliance for a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit\n\n#### 1. Federal Tax Filings (IRS Requirements)\n- **Annual Information Return**: Most 501(c)(3) organizations must file an annual return with the IRS, even if they have no income. Options include:\n  - **Form 990-N (e-Postcard)**: For organizations with gross receipts of $50,000 or less. No fee; filed online.\n  - **Form 990-EZ**: For organizations with gross receipts under $200,000 and total assets under $500,000.\n  - **Form 990**: For larger organizations meeting the above thresholds.\n  - **Form 990-PF**: For private foundations.\n- **Due Date**: Forms are due by the 15th day of the 5th month after the end of your fiscal year (e.g., May 15 for a December 31 fiscal year-end). Extensions are available.\n- **Penalties**: Failure to file for 3 consecutive years results in automatic revocation of 501(c)(3) status.\n- **Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)**: If your nonprofit earns income from activities unrelated to its exempt purpose (e.g., selling merchandise not tied to your mission), file Form 990-T and pay taxes on that income.\n\n#### 2. State Compliance\n- **Annual Reports**: Many states require nonprofits to file annual or biennial reports with the Secretary of State to maintain good standing. Fees and deadlines vary.\n- **Charitable Solicitation Renewals**: Renew state charitable solicitation registrations annually if required.\n- **State Taxes**: File any required state tax returns or exemption renewals.\n\n#### 3. Maintain Proper Records\n- Keep detailed records of:\n  - Financial transactions (receipts, invoices, bank statements).\n  - Board meeting minutes and resolutions.\n  - Donor records (especially for contributions over $250, to issue written acknowledgments for tax deductions).\n  - Employment records (if you have staff).\n- Retain records for at least 7 years (or as required by state law) for financial documents and permanently for key organizational documents like the IRS determination letter.\n\n#### 4. Adhere to Governance and Operational Rules\n- **Board Oversight**: Hold regular board meetings (as specified in bylaws) and document decisions through minutes.\n- **Conflict of Interest**: Enforce a conflict-of-interest policy to prevent board members or staff from benefiting personally from nonprofit activities.\n- **Public Disclosure**: Make certain documents available to the public upon request, including:\n  - IRS determination letter.\n  - Form 990 filings for the past 3 years.\n  - Application for exemption (Form 1023).\n\n#### 5. Fundraising and Donor Compliance\n- Provide written acknowledgments for donations of $250 or more, including your organization\u2019s name, the donation amount (or description of non-cash contributions), and a statement that no goods or services were provided in return (if applicable).\n- Comply with state and federal fundraising laws, including online fundraising and crowdfunding regulations.\n- Be transparent about how funds are used to maintain donor trust.\n\n#### 6. Employment and Payroll Compliance (If Applicable)\n- If you hire employees, comply with federal and state labor laws:\n  - Withhold payroll taxes and file IRS Form 941 (quarterly federal tax return).\n  - File Form W-2 for employees and Form 1099-NEC for contractors.\n  - Comply with minimum wage, overtime, and workplace safety laws.\n- Consider worker\u2019s compensation insurance and other required benefits.\n\n#### 7. Avoid Prohibited Activities\n- **Political Activity**: Do not endorse or oppose political candidates. Limited lobbying is allowed but must not be a substantial part of activities (consider the \u201Csubstantial part test\u201D or elect the 501(h) expenditure test for clear spending limits on"
