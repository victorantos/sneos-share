    "DeepSeek": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive guide to preventive health screenings by age, designed to help you catch diseases early when they are most treatable.\n\n### **Important Disclaimer**\nThis is a general guide based on recommendations from leading health organizations like the U.S. Preventive Services Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Cancer Society (ACS), and others. **Your personal health plan must be developed with your doctor,** who will consider your family history, personal health history, lifestyle, and specific risk factors.\n\n---\n\n### **The Foundation: For All Adults (18\u002B)**\n\nThese are baseline checks and healthy habits that form the foundation of preventive care.\n\n*   **Annual Physical/Wellness Visit:** Even if you feel healthy, this is a chance to discuss your health with your doctor.\n*   **Blood Pressure:** Check at least every 2 years if normal (\u003C120/80), or more often if elevated.\n*   **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Calculated annually to screen for obesity.\n*   **Dental Check-up:** Every 6 months for cleaning and exam.\n*   **Vision Check:** Every 2 years, or as recommended.\n*   **Skin Check:** Self-exams monthly and a clinical exam by your doctor during your physical.\n*   **Immunizations:** Stay up-to-date on Tdap/Td (tetanus) boosters every 10 years, annual flu shot, and COVID-19 vaccines/boosters.\n\n---\n\n### **In Your 20s**\n\nBuilding on the foundation, these screenings become important.\n\n*   **Clinical Skin Exam:** Annually if you have a family history of melanoma, fair skin, many moles, or a history of sunburns.\n*   **Clinical Breast Exam (for women):** Discuss with your doctor; often part of a well-woman exam.\n*   **Pap Smear (for women):** Start at age 21. If normal, every 3 years.\n*   **Cholesterol (Lipid Panel):** Baseline test in your 20s. If normal, repeat every 4-6 years.\n*   **STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection) Testing:** Annually or with new partners if sexually active.\n*   **Testicular Exam (for men):** Discuss self-exams with your doctor; clinical exam as part of a physical.\n\n---\n\n### **In Your 30s**\n\nContinuing previous screenings and adding a few more.\n\n*   **All screenings from your 20s continue** (with updated Pap Smear frequency: women 30\u002B can do Pap smear every 3 years *or* Pap \u002B HPV test every 5 years).\n*   **Diabetes (Blood Glucose) Screening:** Begin if you are overweight/obese and have one or more additional risk factors (e.g., family history, high blood pressure).\n*   **Thyroid Test (TSH):** Consider a baseline test, especially for women, as thyroid issues become more common.\n\n---\n\n### **In Your 40s**\n\nA pivotal decade for early detection of major diseases.\n\n*   **All previous relevant screenings continue.**\n*   **Mammogram (for women):** The debate is on the starting age. The USPSTF recommends starting at **40**, now recommending mammograms every two years. The ACS recommends starting at 40-44 as an option, with annual screening for all by 45. **Discuss with your doctor what\u0027s right for you based on your risk.**\n*   **Diabetes Screening:** For everyone starting at age 35, and repeated every 3 years if normal.\n*   **Heart Health:** A more thorough cardiovascular risk assessment is often done. Your doctor may consider a **Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Scan** if you are at intermediate risk.\n*   **Colorectal Cancer Screening:** Starting at **age 45** for average-risk individuals. This is a major update from the previous age 50 guideline.\n\n---\n\n### **In Your 50s**\n\nThis is the decade where several key cancer screenings become standard for almost everyone.\n\n*   **All previous relevant screenings continue.**\n*   **Colorectal Cancer Screening:** **Essential for everyone starting at 45.** Options include:\n    *   **Colonoscopy** (every 10 years if normal)\n    *   **Stool-based tests** (like FIT or Cologuard) every 1-3 years.\n*   **Lung Cancer Screening (Low-Dose CT Scan):** For adults aged **50-80** who have a **20-pack-year smoking history** and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.\n*   **Prostate Cancer Screening (for men):** **Discuss with your doctor starting at age 50** (or earlier for high-risk groups like African American men or those with a family history). This involves a PSA blood test and possibly a digital rectal exam.\n*   **Bone Density (DEXA) Scan (for women):** Recommended at age **65**, but earlier if you have risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., early menopause, family history, long-term steroid use).\n\n---\n\n### **In Your 60s \u0026 Beyond**\n\nThe focus remains on cancer, heart, and bone health, while adding screenings for age-related conditions.\n\n*   **All previous relevant screenings continue** (note: some may stop after a certain age, based on life expectancy and health, e.g., colonoscopy may not be recommended after 75-85).\n*   **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Ultrasound (for men):** A one-time screening for men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked.\n*   **Bone Density (DEXA) Scan (for women):** For all women at **age 65**. For men, discuss with your doctor starting at age 70.\n*   **Hearing Test:** Baseline at 60, then regularly as recommended.\n*   **Fall Risk Assessment:** Discuss with your doctor annually.\n*   **Cognitive Assessment:** Your doctor may ask questions to screen for memory issues like dementia or Alzheimer\u0027s.\n*   **Shingles Vaccine:** Recommended for adults 50\u002B and adults 19\u002B who are immunocompromised.\n*   **Pneumococcal Vaccines:** Recommended for all adults 65\u002B.\n\n### **Summary Table: Key Screening Milestones**\n\n| Screening Test | Population | Recommended Starting Age \u0026 Frequency |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Blood Pressure** | All Adults | Every 2\u002B years (from 18\u002B) |\n| **Cholesterol** | All Adults | Baseline in 20s, then every 4-6 years |\n| **Pap Smear** | Women | Start at 21, every 3 years (or co-testing 5yrs from 30\u002B) |\n| **Mammogram** | Women | **Discuss at 40.** By 45-50, regularly (annually or biennially) |\n| **Colorectal Cancer** | All Adults | **Start at 45.** Colonoscopy (10yrs) or stool test (1-3yrs) |\n| **Prostate Cancer (PSA)** | Men | **Discuss at 50** (45 for high risk) |\n| **Lung Cancer (LDCT)** | Heavy Smokers | 50-80 with 20-pack-year history |\n| **Bone Density (DEXA)** | Women | 65 (or earlier if high risk) |\n| **Diabetes** | All Adults | Start at 35 if overweight, repeat every 3 years |\n| **AAA Ultrasound** | Men (smokers) | One-time at 65-75 |\n\nEmpower yourself by being an active participant in your health.
