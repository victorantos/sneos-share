    "DeepSeek": "Of course. AI meeting assistant tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence (primarily natural language processing - NLP) to automate and enhance various aspects of meetings, from preparation and note-taking to follow-up and analysis.\n\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive guide to what they are, what they do, key players, and how to choose one.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Capabilities: What Do They Actually Do?**\n\nAI meeting assistants typically offer a suite of features that tackle the entire meeting lifecycle.\n\n#### **1. Pre-Meeting**\n*   **Automated Scheduling:** Integrate with your calendar to find mutual free slots, send invites, and avoid back-and-forth emails.\n*   **Agenda Setting:** Help create and share agendas, prompting participants to add topics.\n\n#### **2. During the Meeting**\n*   **Automatic Recording \u0026 Transcription:** Join the meeting (e.g., as a separate participant in Zoom/Teams) and record audio/video while generating a real-time, highly accurate transcript.\n*   **Speaker Identification:** Differentiate between who is speaking (e.g., \u0022Sarah,\u0022 \u0022Mark\u0022).\n*   **Live Summarization:** Generate real-time summaries of key points and decisions as the conversation happens.\n*   **Action Item \u0026 Decision Tracking:** Automatically detect and highlight tasks (\u0022action items\u0022), decisions made, and key questions.\n\n#### **3. Post-Meeting**\n*   **Intelligent Meeting Summaries:** Create concise, well-structured summaries that capture the essence of the meeting without you having to read the full transcript.\n*   **Highlight Reels:** Create short video clips of the most important moments.\n*   **Automated Follow-ups:** Generate and send email recaps with the summary, action items, and decisions to all attendees (and even those who missed it).\n*   **Knowledge Management:** Store transcripts, summaries, and recordings in a searchable repository. You can later ask, \u0022What did we decide about the Q4 budget in any meeting?\u0022\n\n---\n\n### **Popular AI Meeting Assistant Tools (The Key Players)**\n\nThe market is crowded, but here are some of the most prominent and well-regarded tools:\n\n#### **The All-Rounders (Great for General Use)**\n*   **Otter.ai:** One of the pioneers.
