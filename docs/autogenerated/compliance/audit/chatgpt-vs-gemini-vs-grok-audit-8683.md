    "Gemini": "Okay, here are some free accessibility audit tools, categorized for clarity, along with some important considerations:\n\n**Browser-Based Tools (Extensions and Built-in):**\n\n*   **Lighthouse (Built into Chrome Developer Tools):**  This is arguably the most powerful and widely used free tool.  It runs a series of audits against a page and provides detailed reports on performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO, and PWA readiness.  It uses the axe-core library (see below).\n    *   **How to use:** Open Chrome Developer Tools (right-click on a webpage and select \u0022Inspect\u0022 or press F12), then navigate to the \u0022Lighthouse\u0022 tab.  Select the \u0022Accessibility\u0022 checkbox and click \u0022Generate report\u0022.\n    *   **Pros:**  Comprehensive, well-maintained, integrated into Chrome, command-line interface (CLI) available for automated testing.\n    *   **Cons:** Can\u0027t test authenticated areas without more setup.\n\n*   **axe DevTools - Web Accessibility Testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge):**  A browser extension developed by Deque Systems, the creators of axe-core.  It provides detailed accessibility testing and highlights issues directly on the page.\n    *   **How to use:** Install the extension, open Developer Tools, and select the \u0022axe DevTools\u0022 tab.  Run the analysis.\n    *   **Pros:**  Accurate, well-respected, and offers guidance on how to fix issues.  The commercial versions offer more advanced features.\n    *   **Cons:** Some features are behind a paywall.\n\n*   **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) (Chrome, Firefox):**  Another popular browser extension.  It injects icons and indicators directly onto the page to show accessibility issues and structural elements.\n    *   **How to use:** Install the extension and click the WAVE icon in your browser toolbar while on the page you want to test.\n    *   **Pros:**  Visually clear representation of issues on the page.  Good for quickly identifying common problems.\n    *   **Cons:**  Can sometimes clutter the page with icons.  Less detailed explanations than axe.\n\n*   **Accessibility Insights for Web (Chrome, Edge):** Microsoft\u0027s accessibility testing tool.  Offers multiple testing approaches: FastPass (automated checks), Assessment (guided manual testing), and Live (real-time testing while you navigate).\n    *   **How to use:** Install the extension.  Open Developer Tools and select the \u0022Accessibility Insights\u0022 tab.\n    *   **Pros:**  Offers a good balance of automated and manual testing.  Integrates with VS Code for code analysis.\n    *   **Cons:** Newer compared to others, so the community support might be smaller.\n\n*   **ARC Toolkit (Chrome):** Another accessibility testing tool focusing on WCAG compliance.\n    *   **Pros:** Detailed reporting and guidance.\n    *   **Cons:** User interface can be a little clunky.\n\n**Online Web-Based Tools (Website Analyzers):**\n\n*   **WebAIM\u0027s WAVE Online Tool:** A web-based version of the WAVE tool.  You enter a URL, and it generates a report.  Useful for quick checks without needing an extension.\n    *   **How to use:** Go to the WebAIM website and enter the URL.\n    *   **Pros:**  Easy to use, no installation required.\n    *   **Cons:**  Can\u0027t test authenticated areas or local files easily.  Not ideal for complex web applications.\n\n*   **A11y Compliance Platform:**  Tests single pages for WCAG compliance.  Free version with limitations.\n    *   **Pros:**  Clear reporting.\n    *   **Cons:** Free version is limited.\n\n*   **AChecker:**  Evaluates single HTML pages for accessibility.\n    *   **Pros:** Customizable rulesets.\n    *   **Cons:** Interface is somewhat dated.\n\n**Libraries \u0026 Frameworks (For Developers):**\n\n*   **axe-core:**  A powerful and lightweight accessibility testing engine written in JavaScript.  It\u0027s the underlying engine used by many other tools (like Lighthouse and axe DevTools).\n    *   **How to use:** Integrate it into your testing framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress, Selenium).\n    *   **Pros:** Highly accurate, flexible, and can be used for automated testing.\n    *   **Cons:** Requires coding knowledge to use effectively.\n\n**Important Considerations and Limitations:**\n\n*   **Automated Testing is Not Enough:**  Automated tools can only detect about 30-40% of accessibility issues.  Manual testing with assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard navigation) is crucial.\n\n*   **Context Matters:**  Accessibility issues need to be interpreted in the context of the website\u0027s purpose and target audience.  A tool might flag something as an error, but it might be acceptable in a specific situation.\n\n*   **WCAG Knowledge is Essential:**  To effectively use these tools and understand the reports, you need a basic understanding of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n\n*   **Dynamic Content:**  Some tools may struggle with dynamic content (content that changes after the page loads).  You might need to use more advanced testing techniques to ensure accessibility.\n\n*   **Authentication:** Many of the online tools struggle to test pages that require you to log in. You may need to use local browser extensions or tools to properly test these pages.\n\n*   **Free vs. Paid Tools:**  Free tools are a great starting point, but paid tools often offer more advanced features, better reporting, and dedicated support.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Start with Lighthouse:**  It\u0027s built into Chrome and provides a solid foundation for accessibility testing.\n\n2.  **Use axe DevTools or WAVE:**  Install a browser extension like axe DevTools or WAVE to get more detailed information about accessibility issues on your pages.\n\n3.  **Learn WCAG:**  Invest time in learning the WCAG guidelines.  This will help you understand the reports and fix the issues effectively.\n\n4.  **Combine Automated and Manual Testing:**  Don\u0027t rely solely on automated tools.  Perform manual testing with assistive technologies.\n\n5.  **Consider Paid Tools for Larger Projects:**  If you\u0027re working on a large or complex project, consider investing in a paid accessibility testing tool.\n\nBy using these tools and following the recommendations, you can significantly improve the accessibility of your websites and web applications. Remember that accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. Good luck!\n",
