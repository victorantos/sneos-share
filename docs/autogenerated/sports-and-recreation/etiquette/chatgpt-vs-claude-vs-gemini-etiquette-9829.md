    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down pickleball court etiquette to ensure everyone has a fun and respectful playing experience. This guide covers everything from entering the court to line calls and sportsmanship.\n\n**I. Before the Game: Getting On \u0026 Warm-Up**\n\n*   **Waiting Your Turn:**\n    *   **Stacking:**  A common practice is to \u0022stack\u0022 paddles (or bags, sometimes) neatly outside the court to indicate the order in which teams are waiting to play.  The first team in the stack is next.  Make sure the stack is visible and organized so everyone knows the order.\n    *   **Verbal Agreement:** If there isn\u0027t a clear stacking system, verbally establish the order with the other players waiting.  A simple, \u0022Are you next?\u0022 works wonders.\n    *   **Respect the Order:** Don\u0027t cut in line. This is a big no-no.\n    *   **Know the Rules for Staying On:** Some courts have a \u0022winners stay on\u0022 policy (often limited to a certain number of consecutive games).  Make sure you know the local rules.\n*   **Entering the Court:**\n    *   **Wait for a Break:** Don\u0027t walk onto a court while a point is in progress.  Wait for a natural break in play (between points or games).\n    *   **Announce Yourself:** Call out \u0022Court open?\u0022 or \u0022Excuse me\u0022 clearly before entering.\n    *   **Gather Balls:** If there are loose balls on the court, help collect them.\n*   **Warm-Up:**\n    *   **Communicate:** Coordinate warm-up with your partner and the opposing team. Decide how long you\u0027ll warm up for. A few minutes is usually sufficient.\n    *   **Respect Court Space:** Be mindful of where you\u0027re hitting the ball. Don\u0027t hit directly at other players without warning.\n    *   **Gentle Start:** Begin with dinks and groundstrokes. Gradually increase intensity.\n\n**II. During the Game: Play \u0026 Calls**\n\n*   **Serving:**\n    *   **Announce the Score:** Clearly announce the score before *every* serve.  Use the proper format: Server score - Receiver score - Server number (1 or 2, if applicable).\n    *   **Visual Contact:** Make eye contact with the receiver to ensure they\u0027re ready.\n    *   **Clear Service Motion:** Serve underhand, making contact with the ball below your waist.\n*   **Line Calls:**\n    *   **Honesty is Paramount:**  Make fair and honest calls. When in doubt, give the point to your opponent.\n    *   **Your Side, Your Call:**  You are primarily responsible for making calls on *your* side of the net.\n    *   **Out Calls:**  Call \u0022Out\u0022 loudly and clearly as soon as you see the ball land out.\n    *   **In Calls:**  If you can\u0027t definitively say the ball was out, it\u0027s considered in.  Don\u0027t say anything and let the play continue.\n    *   **Objections:**  If you disagree with a call, politely discuss it with the opposing team.  If you can\u0027t reach an agreement, replay the point.  Avoid arguments.\n    *   **No Foot Faulting by Opponents:** It\u0027s generally considered impolite (and can be seen as gamesmanship) to call a foot fault on your opponent. Let them be responsible for calling it on themselves.\n    *   **No Arguing with Calls:** Arguing is generally frowned upon. Be respectful.\n*   **General Play:**\n    *   **Retrieve Balls Carefully:** If a ball from your court goes onto another court, wait for a break in their play before retrieving it.  Call out \u0022Ball on court!\u0022 to warn them.  Do the same if a ball from another court comes onto yours.\n    *   **Avoid Distractions:** Don\u0027t make excessive noise or movements that could distract other players.\n    *   **Stay Out of the Kitchen (Non-Volley Zone):** Be mindful of the non-volley zone rule. Don\u0027t step into it to volley a ball unless the ball has already bounced first.\n*   **Between Points:**\n    *   **Quick Transition:** Move quickly between points to keep the game flowing.\n    *   **Retrieve Balls Efficiently:** If you\u0027re near a ball after a point, pick it up and return it to the server or the sidelines.\n    *   **Avoid Coaching:** Unless you are playing in a sanctioned event with designated timeouts, avoid coaching from the sidelines during play.\n*   **Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen) Etiquette**\n    * Be very aware of where your feet are in relationship to the kitchen line.\n    * Do not step into the kitchen and volley the ball. This is a fault.\n    * If momentum carries you into the kitchen after volleying outside of it, that is allowed.\n    * Do not reach over the net to hit the ball, unless the ball has bounced on your side of the net first and then travelled back over the net (due to spin or wind).\n\n**III. After the Game: Sportsmanship \u0026 Leaving**\n\n*   **Congratulate Your Opponents:**  Always shake hands or bump paddles with your opponents and say \u0022Good game.\u0022\n*   **Thank You:** Thank your partner for playing with you.\n*   **Leave the Court Clean:** Pick up any trash, stray balls, or personal belongings.\n*   **Inform the Next Team:** If there\u0027s a team waiting, let them know the court is now open.\n*   **Be Graceful in Victory or Defeat:**  Win or lose, maintain a positive attitude. Avoid gloating or making excuses.\n\n**IV. General Court Decorum**\n\n*   **Be Respectful:** Treat all players with respect, regardless of their skill level.\n*   **Be Patient:** Everyone learns at their own pace. Be patient with beginners.\n*   **Be Inclusive:** Welcome new players and make them feel comfortable.\n*   **Control Your Temper:** Pickleball can be competitive, but avoid outbursts of anger or frustration.\n*   **No Profanity:** Refrain from using foul language on the court.\n*   **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** Pay attention to what\u0027s happening on other courts and avoid interfering with their play.\n*   **Offer Advice Graciously:** If you see someone struggling, offer helpful advice, but only if they\u0027re receptive to it.\n*   **Know the Rules:** Familiarize yourself with the official pickleball rules.  USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) is the official source.\n\n**V. Specific Situations \u0026 Scenarios**\n\n*   **Mixed Doubles:** Be mindful of the skill levels of both players on the opposing team.  Avoid targeting the weaker player excessively.\n*   **Playing with Strangers:** Be friendly and introduce yourself.  Discuss your skill level and preferences before starting the game.\n*   **Playing with Different Skill Levels:** Be adaptable and adjust your game to accommodate the skill levels of all players.\n*   **When to Offer a Replay (Let):**\n    *   If something interferes with play (e.g., a ball rolls onto the court from another court).\n    *   If there is genuine doubt about a line call.\n*   **When *Not* to Offer a Replay:**\n    *   If you simply make a mistake (e.g., hit the ball into the net).\n    *   If you\u0027re trying to gain an unfair advantage.\n\n**VI. A Note on \u0022Kitchen\u0022 Etiquette (Non-Volley Zone)**\n\n*   This area can be tricky!  Know the rules well.\n*   Avoid unnecessary movement in the kitchen if you\u0027re not actively involved in the play.\n*   Don\u0027t crowd the kitchen line if you\u0027re not part of the point.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Respect:** Treat everyone with respect.\n*   **Honesty:** Be honest in your line calls.\n*   **Communication:** Communicate clearly with your partner and opponents.\n*   **Sportsmanship:** Win or lose, be a good sport.\n*   **Patience:** Be patient with yourself and others.\n*   **Knowledge:** Know the rules and etiquette.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you\u0027ll help create a positive and enjoyable pickleball experience for everyone! Good luck, and have fun on the court!\n"
