    "Claude": "Hey Storm! 36 is such a powerful age - you\u0027re hitting that sweet spot where you have real experience under your belt but still plenty of runway ahead. Here\u0027s what I\u0027d want you to know:\n\n**Stop waiting for permission.** At 36, you\u0027ve earned the right to trust your instincts. That thing you\u0027ve been thinking about doing? The career pivot, the relationship conversation, the creative project, the boundary you need to set? You already know what you need to do.\n\n**Your energy is currency now.** You probably can\u0027t bounce back from all-nighters like you used to, and that\u0027s actually a gift. Being more selective about where you spend your time and energy will lead you to better opportunities and relationships.\n\n**The comparison game gets boring.** Everyone\u0027s on different timelines. Some friends are on their second marriage, others are just starting families, some are changing careers entirely. Your path is yours.\n\n**Invest in your future self.** Not just financially (though do that too), but physically, mentally, emotionally. The habits you build now will compound in ways that will amaze you at 46.\n\nWhat\u0027s one thing you\u0027ve been putting off that 36-year-old Storm is finally ready to tackle?\n\nHappy almost-birthday! \uD83C\uDF89",
    "Gemini": "Here\u0027s some life advice for Storm, who is turning 36 this week:\n\n*   **Embrace continuous learning:** Cultivate a growth mindset by remaining curious and seeking opportunities to learn new things. This could involve taking courses, reading books, attending workshops, or simply exploring new topics that pique your interest.\n*   **Value and nurture relationships:** Make time for the people who matter most to you, whether it\u0027s family, friends, or your partner. Invest in these relationships by being present, supportive, and communicative.\n*   **Prioritize your physical and mental health:** Incorporate regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and sufficient sleep into your routine. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or other stress-reduction techniques to manage your mental well-being.\n*   **Take calculated risks:** Don\u0027t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and pursue opportunities that align with your goals, even if they seem daunting. Embrace the possibility of failure as a learning experience and a stepping stone toward growth.\n\nI hope this helps, Storm, and happy early birthday!\n"
