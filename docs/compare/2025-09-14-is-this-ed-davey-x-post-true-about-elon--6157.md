    "Grok": "I\u0027m addressing your query regarding the X post by Ed Davey, which claims that Elon Musk \u0022openly called for violence on our streets yesterday\u0022 and urges politicians to condemn Musk\u0027s rhetoric as dangerous and a threat to British democracy.\n\nBased on recent information available on the web and posts found on X, there is evidence that Elon Musk spoke at a far-right anti-immigration rally in London, associated with Tommy Robinson, on or around September 13, 2025. Multiple news sources, including The Independent, India Today, Mediaite, The Standard, and The Mirror, report that Musk warned the crowd that \u0022violence is coming\u0022 and urged them to \u0022fight back or you die.\u0022 These statements have been widely interpreted as inflammatory, and they align with the context of Ed Davey\u0027s claim about Musk calling for violence.\n\nEd Davey, in posts on X dated September 13 and 14, 2025, explicitly criticized Musk for these remarks, stating that Musk \u0022openly called for violence on our streets yesterday\u0022 and describing his rhetoric as dangerous and a threat to democracy. Davey\u0027s posts also call for cross-party condemnation and suggest that Musk\u0027s actions warrant serious consequences.\n\nHowever, while Musk\u0027s reported statements at the rally\u2014warning of impending violence and urging a fight-back response\u2014can be seen as provocative, it is not entirely clear from the available information whether he explicitly called for immediate violence \u0022on our streets\u0022 as Davey claims. Musk\u0027s exact wording, as reported, focuses on a broader warning and a call to action, which some might interpret as rhetorical or hyperbolic rather than a direct incitement to violence. Additionally, in a separate post on X dated April 7, 2025, Musk has stated that he has not personally advocated for violence, though this predates the rally in question.\n\nGiven the controversial nature of this topic, the interpretation of Musk\u0027s words remains subjective and inconclusive without access to a full transcript or video of his speech. News reports and public sentiment, including Davey\u0027s reaction, suggest that many view Musk\u0027s remarks as dangerous and irresponsible. However, whether they constitute an explicit call for violence \u0022on our streets\u0022 is open to debate.\n\nIn summary, Ed Davey\u0027s X post reflects a widely reported interpretation of Musk\u0027s recent statements at a London rally, but the exact nature of Musk\u0027s words and intent remains a matter of perspective. I recommend reviewing primary sources, such as video footage of the speech, if available, to form a definitive conclusion. For further context, you can refer to recent articles from outlets like The Independent or The Standard, which cover the event and the subsequent backlash.",
    "Gemini": "To determine the truthfulness of Ed Davey\u0027s statement, I need to investigate whether Elon Musk has indeed openly called for violence. I will search for relevant information regarding Elon Musk\u0027s recent statements and any related controversies.\n\n",
    "Claude": "I can see you\u0027re asking about a specific post attributed to Ed Davey (the UK Liberal Democrat leader) regarding Elon Musk. However, I\u0027d need to verify the authenticity and context of both the alleged post and any statements by Musk that it references.\n\nTo properly assess this, I would need:\n- Verification that this post actually came from Ed Davey\u0027s official accounts\n- The specific statements by Musk that are being referenced\n- The full context of any such statements\n\nWithout being able to verify these elements in real-time, I cannot confirm whether this post is genuine or whether the characterization of Musk\u0027s statements is accurate. \n\nIf you\u0027re concerned about the authenticity of social media posts, I\u0027d recommend:\n- Checking official verified accounts directly\n- Looking for reporting from established news sources\n- Being cautious of screenshots that could be manipulated\n\nWould you like me to help you think through how to verify this information through reliable sources?"
