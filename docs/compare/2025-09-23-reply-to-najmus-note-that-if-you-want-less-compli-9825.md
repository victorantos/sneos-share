    "ChatGPT": "Hi Najmus,\n\nIf you want to avoid unnecessary complications, it\u2019s crucial to clearly specify that in your prompts when working with AI. Communication is key\u2014don\u2019t just stand on the sidelines expecting simpler outputs; guide the AI by being explicit about your preferences.\n\nWith the rise of AI coding tools, verbose and overly complex coding patterns have become more common. From what I\u2019ve observed, most popular AI models tend to favor adding extra classes, functions, and code blocks that don\u2019t necessarily add value. This usually stems from the training data filled with \u201Centerprise-grade\u201D style code, where developers sometimes over-engineer just to meet perceived standards or team conventions.\n\nTo all fellow vibe coders and professionals\u2014using AI coding tools is great, but be cautious not to sacrifice simplicity for elegance. Avoid over-engineering your solutions. Always return to first principles, critically evaluate why a practice is being suggested, and adopt it only if it truly addresses a problem or improves your codebase.\n\nKeep it simple and intentional!\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]",
    "Grok": "Hey Najmus, I completely agree with your observations about the tendency of AI coding tools to lean toward unnecessary complexity. You\u0027re spot on about how these tools, trained on vast codebases often filled with over-engineered patterns, replicate verbose structures like extra classes or functions that don\u0027t add real value. It\u2019s a reflection of the \u0022enterprise-grade\u0022 mindset some developers adopt to meet perceived standards rather than focusing on practicality.\n\nYour advice to stick to first principles and prioritize simplicity over elegance is crucial. It\u2019s a reminder that we, as developers, need to actively guide AI tools rather than passively accepting their output. I\u2019ve found that being explicit in prompts\u2014like specifying a preference for minimalistic, straightforward code\u2014can help steer the AI away from overcomplicating things. It\u2019s all about communicating intent clearly and not just standing on the sidelines, as you mentioned.\n\nThanks for highlighting this. It\u2019s a great call to action for all of us to question every practice and ensure it genuinely solves a problem before adopting it. Let\u2019s keep the focus on building clean, effective solutions!",
    "Gemini": "Najmus, that\u0027s a really insightful point about the verbose coding patterns emerging from AI tools. I agree that these models often lean towards unnecessary complexity, generating extra code that doesn\u0027t really add value. It\u0027s like they\u0027re mimicking the \u0022enterprise-grade\u0022 style that some developers adopt, perhaps without fully understanding the underlying reasons.\n\nIt\u0027s important to remember that we need to communicate effectively with these AI tools, not just passively accept their output. If you want less complicated code, you have to specifically ask for it in your prompts. It\u0027s about guiding the AI towards simplicity and questioning the practices it suggests. Don\u0027t fall into the trap of over-engineering just because the AI suggests it! As you said, always stick to first principles and question why a given practice is being applied.\n"
