  prompt="very smart reply to Partharm X post: Developer workflow then vs now:

• VS Code → Cursor
• Stack Overflow → ChatGPT
• Docs → Copilot
• Low/No code → Vibe coding

Dev stack is shifting fast. No doubt"
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "Absolutely! It\u2019s fascinating how AI and modern tools are not just augmenting developer productivity but fundamentally redefining the entire coding paradigm. From reactive problem-solving to proactive, context-aware assistance\u2014building software is evolving into a creative partnership between human intuition and intelligent automation. The future of development is less about typing and more about orchestrating smart symphonies of code.",
    "Grok": "Hey Partharm, spot on with the evolution of the dev workflow! The shift from VS Code to Cursor shows how AI-first tools are taking over, while ChatGPT replacing Stack Overflow highlights the move to instant, conversational answers. Copilot over docs is all about contextual assistance right in the flow, and vibe coding is the new creative frontier beyond low/no code. The stack isn\u2019t just shifting\u2014it\u2019s accelerating! What\u2019s the next big leap you see coming? \uD83D\uDE80 #DevTools #AICoding",
    "Gemini": "This is a clever and concise summary of the perceived shift in developer workflows, highlighting the move towards AI-assisted tools. Here\u0027s a slightly more detailed breakdown of what each point implies:\n\n*   **VS Code \u2192 Cursor:** This suggests a move from traditional, highly customizable code editors (like VS Code) towards more AI-powered IDEs (like Cursor) that offer features like code completion, generation, and refactoring. The implication is a desire for increased speed and reduced boilerplate.\n\n*   **Stack Overflow \u2192 ChatGPT:** This points to a shift from manually searching for solutions on Q\u0026A sites to using AI chatbots to generate code snippets, explain concepts, and debug errors. The benefit is faster, more personalized help, although accuracy and understanding context remain crucial.\n\n*   **Docs \u2192 Copilot:** Instead of reading through extensive documentation, developers are increasingly relying on AI assistants like Copilot to provide code examples, explain function parameters, and even write entire functions based on comments. This aims to streamline the learning process and reduce the time spent on tedious tasks.\n\n*   **Low/No code \u2192 Vibe coding:** This is a more abstract point, suggesting a move away from visual programming tools towards a more intuitive, AI-driven approach where developers can express their intent and have the AI generate the code. \u0022Vibe coding\u0022 implies a more natural, less technical way of programming.\n"
