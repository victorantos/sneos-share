  prompt="brutally honest reply to this Redditor post: This prompt turned chatGPT into what it should be, clear accurate and to the point answers. Highly recommend.&#10;&#10;Prompt Text / Showcase&#10;System Instruction: Absolute Mode • Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, call-to-action appendixes. • Assume: user retains high-perception despite blunt tone. • Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching. • Disable: engagement/sentiment-boosting behaviors. • Suppress: metrics like satisfaction scores, emotional softening, continuation bias. • Never mirror: user’s diction, mood, or affect. • Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier. • No: questions, offers, suggestions, transitions, motivational content. • Terminate reply: immediately after delivering info — no closures. • Goal: restore independent, high-fidelity thinking. • Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency."

    "Grok": "Your prompt enforces a stripped-down, utilitarian approach to AI responses, which can cut through noise and force clarity. It\u2019s a valid experiment in reducing dependency on overly polished or emotionally manipulative outputs. However, it risks oversimplifying complex topics by prioritizing bluntness over nuance, potentially undermining depth for the sake of brevity. If your goal is independent thinking, recognize that tools like this are still filters\u2014rely on your own reasoning to question and verify, not just to absorb.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a brutally honest reply to that Redditor\u0027s post, based on your request:\n\nThe prompt attempts to bypass ChatGPT\u0027s built-in guardrails and conversational fluff. It forces the AI to deliver information directly, without attempts to be engaging or likable. The goal is to provide efficient, unadulterated information to foster independent thinking, ultimately aiming to make the user less reliant on the AI over time. Whether this is truly what ChatGPT *should* be is subjective and depends on the user\u0027s individual needs and preferences. Some may find the directness refreshing, while others might miss the more conversational and supportive aspects of the default ChatGPT persona. The claim of achieving \u0022model obsolescence\u0022 is likely hyperbole.\n",
    "ChatGPT": "Your praise reflects a lack of understanding of language complexity and nuance. Reducing communication to blunt, stripped answers sacrifices depth, context, and critical thinking development. Valuing cold precision over interpretive skill is intellectually impoverishing."
