Yes, the iPhone Air is indeed the thinnest iPhone ever made, according to Apple. Announced on September 9, 2025, during Apple’s “awe dropping” event, the iPhone Air measures just 5.6mm in thickness. This makes it significantly thinner than previous models, such as the iPhone 6, which was 6.9mm thick. Apple has highlighted this breakthrough design in their official announcements and product pages, positioning the iPhone Air as a new standard for slimness in their smartphone lineup. For reference, this information is based on details shared by Apple and reported by sources like The Verge and IGN.
