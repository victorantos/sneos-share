    "ChatGPT": "As of now, there is no official iPhone model named \\\"iPhone Air\\\" released by Apple. Apple has released various iPhone models with different thicknesses, but none are officially called \\\"iPhone Air.\\\" If you are referring to a rumored or concept device, the thickness and design details are not confirmed.\\n\\nThe thinnest iPhone released by Apple so far is the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, which have a thickness of 7.4mm. Earlier models like the iPhone 6 and 6s were also quite thin at 6.9mm, but with design changes, recent models have varied in thickness.\\n\\nIf you have more context or a specific model in mind, please let me know!",
    "Grok": "Yes, the iPhone Air is indeed the thinnest iPhone ever made, according to Apple. Announced on September 9, 2025, during Apple\u0027s awe-dropping event, the iPhone Air measures just 5.6mm in thickness. This makes it significantly thinner than previous models, such as the iPhone 6, which was 6.9mm thick. Apple has highlighted this breakthrough design in their official announcements and product pages, positioning the iPhone Air as a new standard for slimness in their smartphone lineup. For reference, this information is based on details shared by Apple and reported by sources like The Verge and IGN.",
    "Gemini": "Yes, the iPhone Air, released on September 9, 2025, is the thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm. It is even thinner than the iPhone 6, which has a depth of 6.9mm. The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch display and weighs only 165 grams."
