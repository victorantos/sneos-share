    "Gemini": "Here\u0027s a brutal critical reply addressing a TikToker who answered \u0022YES\u0022 to the question of whether a common-law partner can claim an interest in property and place a Certificate of Pending Litigation (CPL) on their partner\u0027s property:\n\n\u0022Okay, so you\u0027re spreading misinformation to potentially thousands of people? Just because you *think* you understand common-law property rights doesn\u0027t mean you do. A simple \u0027yes\u0027 is not only an oversimplification, it\u0027s dangerously misleading. While it *might* be possible in *some* very specific circumstances, it\u0027s far from a guaranteed right!\n\nFirst of all, the laws surrounding common-law relationships and property claims vary wildly depending on the jurisdiction. What\u0027s true in one province, state, or country is completely false in another. Did you bother to mention that? No, of course not.\n\nSecondly, even *if* a common-law partner can potentially claim an interest, it\u0027s not automatic! They generally need to demonstrate a contribution to the property, either financially or through their efforts, and *prove* that it would be unfair for them not to share in its value. A CPL isn\u0027t just slapped on a property because someone *feels* entitled. Courts require evidence and legal grounds.\n\nAnd a Certificate of Pending Litigation? That\u0027s a serious thing! It ties up the property, making it difficult to sell or mortgage. Frivolously placing one can have significant legal and financial consequences for the person filing it. Suggesting it\u0027s a simple, readily available option for common-law partners is irresponsible in the extreme.\n\nSo, TikToker, before you go handing out legal advice, maybe do some actual research and consider the nuances of the law. Otherwise, stick to dancing videos and leave the legal analysis to the professionals.\u0022\n",
    "Grok": "Hey [TikToker\u0027s Name], spreading misinformation like this is straight-up reckless. Saying \u0027YES\u0027 to whether a common-law partner can automatically claim an interest in property and slap a Certificate of Pending Litigation on it is not just misleading, it\u2019s flat-out wrong in most jurisdictions. Common-law rights vary wildly depending on the region, and in many places, property rights aren\u2019t automatically shared without specific legal agreements or contributions. A Certificate of Pending Litigation isn\u2019t some casual tool\u2014it\u2019s a serious legal step that requires a valid claim and court involvement, not just a relationship status. Stop fear-mongering with half-baked takes and do some actual research before you scare people into believing their home is up for grabs. Your platform has reach; use it responsibly, not to peddle nonsense. #DoBetter #FactCheckYourself",
    "ChatGPT": "Are you serious? This isn\u2019t just a simple yes-or-no question for TikTok soundbites. Claiming an interest in property and registering a Certificate of Pending Litigation requires specific legal grounds and varies hugely by jurisdiction. Your reckless \u201CYES\u201D answer spreads misinformation and could mislead countless people into thinking they have rights they don\u2019t actually possess. Maybe spend less time chasing followers and more time doing some real research before giving legal advice you clearly don\u2019t understand."
