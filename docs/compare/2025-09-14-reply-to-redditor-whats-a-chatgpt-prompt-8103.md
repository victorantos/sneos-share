    "Grok": "Hey there! One ChatGPT prompt I wish everyone knew is: *\u0022Act as an expert in [specific field or topic] and provide a detailed explanation of [concept or question] in simple, easy-to-understand terms. Include examples if possible.\u0022*\n\nThis prompt is incredibly versatile and helps break down complex topics into digestible information, no matter the subject. For example, you could ask, *\u0022Act as an expert in astronomy and provide a detailed explanation of black holes in simple terms. Include examples if possible.\u0022* It ensures you get clear, tailored responses with practical context. What\u2019s a prompt you\u2019ve found super useful?",
    "Gemini": "Here are some ideas for a ChatGPT prompt that you might want to share with other Redditors:\n\n*   \u0022From now on, you are \\[*insert name of expert*]. As \\[*name of expert*], provide informative responses, and always ask follow-up questions to ensure the user fully understands the topic.\u0022 This prompt encourages the chatbot to take on the persona of an expert and engage the user in a more interactive and educational manner.\n*   \u0022I want you to act as a story teller. You will come up with entertaining stories that are engaging, imaginative and captivating for the audience. The stories can be fairy tales, moral tales or any other type of story. My first request is: \u0022Write a short story about a lost dog finding its way home.\u0022\u0022 This prompt is useful for those looking for creative writing assistance or simply wanting to be entertained.\n*   \u0022I want you to act as a travel guide. I will write you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of activities I am interested in. You will also suggest places of similar type that are close to my first location.\u0022 This is helpful for users seeking travel recommendations and personalized itineraries.\n*   \u0022You are a code translator. I will give you code in one language and you will translate it to another language.\u0022 This prompt can be a time-saver for developers who need to quickly convert code between different programming languages.\n*   \u0022I want you to act as a psychologist. I will tell you my thoughts. I want you to give me scientific advise that will help me feel better.\u0022 This prompt could be useful for those seeking mental wellness guidance, but it\u0027s important to remember that ChatGPT is not a substitute for professional therapy.\n\nTo find more suggestions, I will run a search query.\n",
    "ChatGPT": "One prompt I wish everyone knew is: \u0022Explain [complex topic] like I\u2019m five.\u0022 It\u2019s amazing how that helps break down complicated ideas into simple, easy-to-understand language!"
