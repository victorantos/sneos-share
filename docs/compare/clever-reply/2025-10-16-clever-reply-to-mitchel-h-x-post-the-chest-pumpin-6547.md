  prompt="clever reply to Mitchel H X post: The chest pumping of the current new wave of SV founders puts a bad taste in my mouth. Just saw a pic of a funded teenage founder showing off his intl business class seat. I still flew coach for 15+ intl flights per year while HC was valued over $2B. &#10;&#10;I don’t want this to sound like “kids these days can’t afford houses cause they buy avo toast.” It’s not that. The price difference of a coach versus biz seat is huge. &#10;&#10;And I always wanted to set the right precedent. If the founder of the multi bill company is flying coach so can everyone else in the company (we didn’t allow any biz flights until similar times, although I kept flying coach longer).&#10;&#10;Won’t call him out because I don’t have the full context and maybe I’m wrong here. And like, I don’t want to shame a teenager and be overly dad mode. But it’s not isolated to that one instance, of course. &#10;&#10;It seems like everyday young founders funded by big names are just trying to outdo each other on wasteful shit."

    "ChatGPT": "Here\u0027s a clever and respectful reply you could post:\n\n\u0022Mitchel, you\u2019re setting a classic \u2018lead by example\u2019 bar that feels vintage in the best way. In a world where flexing business class seats seems like the startup rite of passage, your coach-flight ethos reminds us that humility and prudence are still the ultimate power moves. Here\u2019s hoping the next gen remembers that sustainable growth isn\u2019t just about valuations, but values too.\u0022",
    "Grok": "Totally get it\u2014nothing says \u0022lean startup\u0022 like a founder treating business class like a rite of passage before the first revenue check clears. Precedent is everything; you\u0027re the coach-flying legend who built the blueprint. Maybe the new wave needs a \u0022frugality flex\u0022 challenge to balance the hype? \uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDEEB",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few clever and engaging replies to Mitchel H X post that acknowledge his points while adding to the conversation:\n\n*   \u0022I agree, Mitchel. There\u0027s a difference between celebrating success and flaunting it. Humility can be a powerful leadership tool, especially in the early stages. It sets a tone for the entire company.\u0022\n*   \u0022Interesting point, Mitchel. It\u0027s a balance, right? You want to reward yourself and your team, but staying grounded can be a real asset, especially when building something sustainable.\u0022\n*   \u0022Mitchel, this resonates. It\u0027s not about being \u0027cheap,\u0027 but about setting priorities. That business class seat money could be reinvested in growth or employee development. What message does it send when it\u0027s spent on personal luxury?\u0022\n*   \u0022I\u0027ve seen this too, Mitchel. It feels like some are building a personal brand first and a company second. There\u0027s nothing wrong with enjoying success, but perhaps a little perspective is needed. Lead by example!\u0022\n*   \u0022Good food for thought, Mitchel. Maybe it\u2019s a sign of the times, but the optics do matter. Building a company is a marathon, not a sprint, and frugality (where appropriate) can be a valuable skill.\u0022\n"
