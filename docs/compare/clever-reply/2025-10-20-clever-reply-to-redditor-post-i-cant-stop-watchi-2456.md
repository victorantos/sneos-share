    "ChatGPT": "Here\u0027s a clever yet supportive reply you can use:\n\n\u0022Sounds like your brain\u2019s got you on a stubborn subscription you never signed up for. Maybe it\u2019s time to cancel the service and find a new hobby that pays better dividends\u2014like hitting the gym, picking up a new skill, or even just binge-reading some epic fantasy. Also, consider setting small, manageable goals instead of going cold turkey. Remember, rewiring your brain is a journey, not a sprint. You\u2019ve got this!\u0022",
    "Grok": "Hey man, first off\u2014props for admitting this and reaching out. At 25, you\u0027re smack in the prime of life, and porn\u0027s like that sneaky side quest in a video game: it feels like a quick win but derails the main storyline (your focus, mental health, the works). I\u0027ve been there, and here\u0027s the real talk from one dude to another:\n\nThe urge isn\u0027t you being weak; it\u0027s your brain chasing that dopamine hit like it\u0027s free pizza. Key move: **track your triggers** without judgment. Boredom? Stress? Late-night scrolling? Log \u0027em for a week\u2014awareness alone cuts the power by half.\n\nThen, **redirect like a boss**. Cold turkey often backfires (relapse city), so swap it out:\n- Hit the gym or run\u2014channel that energy into endorphins that actually build you up.\n- Pick a hobby that absorbs you: guitar, coding, reading something epic. Make your phone a tool, not a trap\u2014install blockers like Freedom or just mute keywords on socials.\n- When the itch hits, do the \u00225-minute rule\u0022: Wait it out with deep breaths, a walk, or blasting music. Nine times out of ten, it fades.\n\nIf it\u0027s messing with your head bad (anxiety, fog), talk to a doc\u2014stuff like therapy or even apps like Fortify can help rewire without shame. You\u0027ve got this; quitting isn\u0027t about perfection, it\u0027s about stacking small wins. One day porn-free = clearer head. 30 days? You\u0027ll wonder why you ever bothered. DM if you need more\u2014solidarity, brother.",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few possible replies to the Reddit post, offering different angles of advice:\n\n**Reply 1: Focusing on habit replacement and self-compassion**\n\n\u0022Hey man, I hear you. It sounds like you\u0027re stuck in a loop that you want to break. Don\u0027t beat yourself up too much about it; these urges can be really powerful. Instead of just trying to *stop* (which is super hard), maybe try *replacing* the habit. When you feel the urge coming on, immediately do something else \u2013 go for a walk, read a book, hit the gym, call a friend. Anything to distract your mind and break the pattern. Also, be kind to yourself when you slip up. It\u0027s a process, not an instant fix.\u0022\n\n**Reply 2: Suggesting professional help and a supportive community**\n\n\u0022It takes courage to admit this, so good on you for reaching out. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your life, and it might be more than you can handle on your own. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? There are professionals who specialize in helping people with compulsive behaviors. Also, there are online communities and support groups where you can connect with others who are going through the same thing. Knowing you\u0027re not alone and getting support can make a huge difference.\u0022\n\n**Reply 3: Addressing potential underlying issues**\n\n\u0022I understand where you\u0027re coming from. Porn can be a really easy escape, but it often masks other issues. Are you feeling stressed, lonely, or bored? Maybe try to identify what triggers these urges. Once you figure out the root cause, you can start addressing the real problem instead of just fighting the symptom. Consider journaling, meditation, or even just talking to a trusted friend or family member.\u0022\n\nTo provide more tailored advice, some additional information would be helpful:\n\n*   How long have you been experiencing these strong urges?\n*   What have you already tried to stop?\n*   Are there any specific times or situations that trigger the urges?\n\n"
