    "ChatGPT": "Hey Crys, sending you strength and good vibes! Divorce after 21 years is no small thing, but remember: sometimes the best \u201Casset\u201D is peace of mind\u2014even if it starts with just your bed. For legal help, have you checked out Wisconsin\u2019s legal aid clinics or local law school programs? They often offer free consultations or low-cost advice. You deserve to know your rights clearly before that October 30 trial. Hang in there\u2014you\u2019ve got this! \uD83D\uDCAA\u2728",
    "Grok": "Hey Crys, first off, hugs\u201421 years is a marathon, and starting over with just a bed sounds brutal. You\u0027re not alone in this; Wisconsin has some solid free or low-cost options to help you figure out your rights (like property division and potential maintenance after a long marriage). \n\nCheck out Legal Action of Wisconsin\u2014they do intakes for folks in tough spots and might qualify you for help: legalaction.org or call (855) 947-2529. Also, ABA Free Legal Answers (wi.freelegalanswers.org) lets you post questions online for free advice from volunteer lawyers. For a quick consult, firms like Divergent Family Law or Divorce PRO Wisconsin offer free initial chats\u2014Google \u0027em for local numbers.\n\nYou\u0027ve got time before Oct 30\u2014reach out today and arm yourself with info. You\u0027ve earned better; rooting for you! \uD83D\uDCAA",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here are a few reply options for Crys\u0027s Facebook post that are supportive and helpful, given her situation:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on Urgency \u0026 Free Legal Help):**\n\n\u003E Crys, I\u0027m so sorry to hear what you\u0027re going through. With your trial date so close (October 30th!), it\u0027s really important to get some legal advice ASAP. Since you mentioned affordability is a concern, you could try contacting the Wisconsin State Bar\u0027s Lawyer Referral and Information Service. They might be able to connect you with lawyers who offer free or reduced-cost consultations. Also, check if there are any legal aid societies in your area that handle divorce cases. Time is of the essence, so start reaching out now! I hope you find the guidance you need.\n\n**Option 2 (Emphasize Rights \u0026 Suggest Specific Search):**\n\n\u003E Crys, divorce after a long marriage can be incredibly complex, especially when finances are tight. It\u0027s good you\u0027re looking into your rights. In Wisconsin, things like property division, spousal support (alimony), and other factors will be considered. Because your trial is so soon, I would suggest searching Google for \u0022free legal aid divorce Wisconsin\u0022 and also \u0022pro bono family law attorneys Wisconsin\u0022 to see if you can find immediate help. Many lawyers offer a free initial consultation, which could really help you understand your options before the 30th. Sending you strength!\n\n**Option 3 (Acknowledge Difficulty \u0026 Offer Encouragement):**\n\n\u003E Crys, I can only imagine how stressful this must be. 21 years is a long time, and it\u0027s understandable you\u0027re worried, especially with the trial looming. Don\u0027t give up! There are resources available. Besides contacting legal aid, see if there\u0027s a local women\u0027s resource center in your area. They often have connections to legal services or can offer support during this difficult time. Thinking of you and hoping you get the legal guidance you deserve.\n\nBefore posting, I will run a search to provide links to the resources mentioned above.\n"
