  prompt="clever reply to Facebook user: Anonymous participant&#10;17 October at 03:19&#10;  ·&#10;Quick question — my aunt is in the middle of a divorce and is considering cosigning a mortgage for me. She would only be on the loan, not on the title. Does anyone know if her soon-to-be ex could make any claim to the house or equity because of that, or is she safe since her name wouldn’t be on the deed?"
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "Here\u0027s a clever and thoughtful reply you could use:\n\n\u0022Great question! While your aunt isn\u0027t on the deed, being on the loan still means she has a financial connection to the property. Divorce laws vary by state, but sometimes creditors or ex-spouses can pursue assets linked to debt obligations, especially if the mortgage payments impact marital finances. It\u2019s definitely wise for her to consult a family law attorney to understand any potential risks before signing on the dotted line. Better safe than tangled in a homegrown legal drama!\u0022",
    "Grok": "Hey, great question\u2014divorces and loans are like oil and water, always messy! Short answer: Your aunt should be safe from her ex claiming the house or any equity in it, since she\u0027s not on the title/deed. That means no ownership stake for her (or him by extension). The cosigned loan is just her financial obligation to the lender, not a piece of the property pie.\n\nThat said, the debt could still factor into the divorce settlement (like how assets/debts get divided), so her soon-to-be-ex might push for her to handle it or offset it somehow. I\u0027d tell her to chat with her divorce lawyer before signing anything\u2014better safe than sorry (and potentially stuck with a surprise bill). Congrats on the house hunt, though! \uD83C\uDFE0",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few possible replies to the Facebook user\u0027s question, keeping in mind that I am an AI and this is not financial or legal advice:\n\n**Reply 1 (Humorous but cautious):**\n\n\u0022IANAL (I am not a lawyer), but it sounds like your aunt is being super generous! As long as she\u0027s ONLY on the loan and not on the title, it *should* shield the house itself from becoming a marital asset. However, her ex *could* potentially argue that her cosigning is a dissipation of marital assets (basically, her using marital funds/credit to benefit someone else). It might be wise for her to run this by her divorce attorney to be 100% safe. Better safe than sorry when divorce and finances mix!\u0022\n\n**Reply 2 (Direct and Suggestive):**\n\n\u0022Since she\u0027s only cosigning and not on the title, the house itself should be safe. However, the *act* of cosigning *could* be viewed as impacting marital assets. To get a real answer, she needs to speak with her divorce lawyer. They\u0027ll know the specifics of her case and local laws.\u0022\n\n**Reply 3 (Emphasis on Professional Advice):**\n\n\u0022This is a tricky situation with the divorce in progress. While the house itself might be protected since she won\u0027t be on the title, the act of cosigning could have implications in her divorce proceedings. Consulting with her attorney is the best course of action here. They can advise her on the specific risks in her situation.\u0022\n\nTo provide a more tailored answer, it would be helpful to know:\n\n*   **The state/location:** Laws vary significantly by location.\n*   **The nature of the divorce:** Is it amicable, or high-conflict? This impacts how closely assets are scrutinized.\n\nTo gather more information, I will perform some searches.\n"
