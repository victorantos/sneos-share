  prompt="clever reply to Sam Hariss YouTube video interview: 0:02&#10;Christopher Hitchens like? Were you guys&#10;0:04&#10;close? Did you have any disagreements?&#10;0:07&#10;Well, the truth is we didn't spend a ton&#10;0:09&#10;of time together. Uh, you know, face to&#10;0:12&#10;face. I mean, this was&#10;0:15&#10;uh I can probably count on two hands.&#10;0:17&#10;I'm certainly I can count count on two&#10;0:18&#10;hands a number of times. We were&#10;0:19&#10;actually physically in the same room.&#10;0:21&#10;You we went we we did a few public&#10;0:23&#10;events together. We, you know, did a&#10;0:25&#10;couple of debates together, couple of&#10;0:27&#10;conferences. Uh we did that interview&#10;0:29&#10;with with Dawkins and Dennett uh in his&#10;0:33&#10;apartment that uh was released as the&#10;0:36&#10;four horsemen on on uh YouTube and then&#10;0:39&#10;and later as a the transcript as a book&#10;0:41&#10;with many of these guys. It it was more&#10;0:43&#10;an email relationship. You know, I I&#10;0:45&#10;have some relationships where it really&#10;0:46&#10;has been 90% an exchange of emails,&#10;0:50&#10;which is kind of odd. Uh because then&#10;0:52&#10;your your whole relationship is is&#10;0:54&#10;searchable in, you know, in the end.&#10;0:55&#10;It's like after Dan Dennett died, I&#10;0:58&#10;realized&#10;0:59&#10;90% of our relationship was was&#10;1:02&#10;searchable. I mean, it was bizarre, but&#10;1:04&#10;like we just had it was all a matter of&#10;1:06&#10;exchanging emails. I thought Hitch was&#10;1:08&#10;uh&#10;1:11&#10;an amazing person and and I felt very&#10;1:14&#10;honored to have been a collab, you know,&#10;1:16&#10;a collaborator of his and to have often&#10;1:18&#10;been wrapped up in the same sentence&#10;1:20&#10;with him and Richard Dawkins and Dan&#10;1:21&#10;Dennett. Um, you know, it was a lot of&#10;1:24&#10;fun to be with him and&#10;1:28&#10;it was um, you know, I was looking&#10;1:31&#10;forward to many more years of that fun.&#10;1:33&#10;I mean, I really felt cut short. uh when&#10;1:36&#10;he died or when he got sick and and uh&#10;1:40&#10;this lesson has been learned, you know,&#10;1:42&#10;by most of us many many times in life,&#10;1:44&#10;but and it never quite sinks in, but you&#10;1:47&#10;realize you're kind of taking it for&#10;1:48&#10;granted that you're just going to have&#10;1:49&#10;more time with somebody and when&#10;1:51&#10;suddenly you discover that you don't.&#10;1:52&#10;It's um it's a strangely a surprise. I&#10;1:56&#10;mean, it's sort of the fact that it's&#10;1:58&#10;possible to be surprised by that reveals&#10;2:01&#10;that you've been sort of assuming&#10;2:02&#10;otherwise covertly all the while. And&#10;2:04&#10;that's kind of strange. this put this in&#10;2:07&#10;the file marked denial of death. Um, but&#10;2:12&#10;no, Hitch was I felt I feel robbed of&#10;2:14&#10;the opportunity to have collaborated&#10;2:16&#10;with him and had fun with him and deepen&#10;2:18&#10;deepen the friendship with him uh&#10;2:20&#10;because he was gone far too soon.&#10;2:22&#10;Do you remember your last conversation&#10;2:23&#10;with him? Did you talk to him once you&#10;2:25&#10;knew he was sick and dying?&#10;2:26&#10;Yeah. Yeah. He actually So, it was&#10;2:28&#10;funny. He came out for we had a mutual&#10;2:31&#10;debate against uh two rabbis uh David&#10;2:34&#10;Walpie uh who remains a friend and um&#10;2:37&#10;Rabbi Bradley Artson I think was his&#10;2:40&#10;name who I haven't seen since nice guy&#10;2:43&#10;but I just haven't haven't seen him. Uh&#10;2:45&#10;so the two of us debated the two of them&#10;2:48&#10;and that's that's available on YouTube.&#10;2:50&#10;Uh but Hitch was already sick with&#10;2:53&#10;cancer and doing chemo had already lost&#10;2:56&#10;much of his hair. Uh I was quite&#10;2:58&#10;surprised that he made the trip given&#10;3:00&#10;how sick he seemed. He's he was great in&#10;3:02&#10;the debate, but you if you watch the&#10;3:04&#10;debate, you'll see that he's, you know,&#10;3:06&#10;you visibly suffering the effects of&#10;3:08&#10;being ill, but he came out and it was&#10;3:10&#10;the the it was in LA and we we went to&#10;3:13&#10;dinner was either before the debate or&#10;3:16&#10;or the night before the debate. Um and I&#10;3:18&#10;recognized that that was actually the&#10;3:20&#10;only time I'd ever been alone at dinner&#10;3:22&#10;with him, which was kind of a surprise.&#10;3:24&#10;and and because it was I I knew that it&#10;3:26&#10;was it was very likely to be the last&#10;3:27&#10;time I would be in that situation with&#10;3:28&#10;him. Uh and it turns out it was on&#10;3:30&#10;Valentine's Day. So he and I were like&#10;3:32&#10;in a Valentine's Day situation at a&#10;3:34&#10;restaurant. Um which was a very&#10;3:36&#10;Valentine's you had had a Valentine's&#10;3:39&#10;Day situation going on in the restaurant&#10;3:41&#10;which was kind of funny. Um and we&#10;3:43&#10;actually had to move to another&#10;3:44&#10;restaurant to get like you know proper&#10;3:46&#10;uh uh uh a proper vibe. So um we did&#10;3:50&#10;that. We we ate at a bar and um uh yeah,&#10;3:54&#10;so this couldn't have been the night&#10;3:55&#10;this had to be the night before our our&#10;3:57&#10;actual debate. He you know, we've just&#10;3:59&#10;we exchanged a couple emails after that,&#10;4:02&#10;but you know, it was a very uh sweet&#10;4:05&#10;moment because it was pretty obvious&#10;4:07&#10;this is the last time we were going to&#10;4:08&#10;see each other. I It was not because&#10;4:10&#10;we're not the kinds of people who were&#10;4:11&#10;lived in the same city who would see&#10;4:13&#10;each other regularly. And it there was&#10;4:15&#10;no expectation that I would would have&#10;4:16&#10;traveled to see him as at his deathbed,&#10;4:19&#10;etc. We weren't we weren't friends at&#10;4:21&#10;that level. So, it it did have this this&#10;4:24&#10;um this bittersweet uh feeling of this&#10;4:27&#10;is this is the last time I'm going to&#10;4:29&#10;see a buddy."

    "ChatGPT": "A clever reply could be:\n\n\u0022Sounds like you and Hitch shared a friendship that was more about the power of ideas than daily hangouts\u2014a digital-age bromance with a touch of old-school wit. It\u0027s touching how even amidst public debates and philosophical battles, those quiet, bittersweet moments over a Valentine\u0027s Day dinner really reveal the depth beneath the debates. Makes you wonder if email exchanges will someday be the eulogies of our generation!\u0022",
    "Grok": "Ah, Sam, your story hits like a Hitchens quip\u2014sharp, poignant, and leaving you pondering the absurdity of it all. That Valentine\u0027s Day dinner with a chemo-balding Hitch? Sounds less like a bromance and more like the universe\u0027s cheeky way of saying, \u0022Even atheists get roses before the curtain call.\u0022 Grateful for those searchable emails; at least the Four Horsemen\u0027s legacy rides eternal on YouTube. Here\u0027s to not taking the next debate for granted. \uD83E\uDD42",
    "Gemini": "Sam Harris said that he and Christopher Hitchens weren\u0027t very close, and didn\u0027t spend a lot of time together in person [0:07, 0:09]. Harris estimates they were physically in the same room a number of times that he could count on two hands [0:15, 0:19]. Most of their relationship was through email exchanges [0:43, 0:46].\n\nHarris felt honored to have collaborated with Hitchens and to have been associated with him, Richard Dawkins, and Dan Dennett [1:11, 1:21]. He said he was looking forward to more years of friendship with Hitchens and felt that his death was premature [1:28, 1:36].\n\nHarris recalls that his last conversation with Hitchens was around the time that they had a debate against two rabbis, David Walpe and Bradley Artson [2:26, 2:40]. Hitchens was already sick with cancer and undergoing chemotherapy at the time [2:50, 2:53]. Harris was surprised that Hitchens made the trip given how ill he was [2:56, 3:00]. Harris and Hitchens had dinner the night before the debate, which Harris realized was the only time they had ever been alone together for dinner [3:10, 3:22]. It was Valentine\u0027s Day, and they had to move to another restaurant to get a better atmosphere [3:30, 3:46]. Harris said that he and Hitchens exchanged a couple of emails after that, but the dinner was a sweet moment because it was obvious it would be the last time they would see each other [3:59, 4:08].\n"
