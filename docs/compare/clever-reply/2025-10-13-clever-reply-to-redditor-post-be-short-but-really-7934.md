  prompt="clever reply to Redditor post, be short but really helpful: I bought a 2 year old car in a private sale. It turns out the car was actually a lease and didn't belong to the man I bought it off. Am I allowed to keep the car?&#10;&#10;Debt &amp; Money&#10;The actual owners of the car have reached out to me to explain they will be collecting the vehicle today. I have driven it into my garage and locked the garage until I figure out what I'm supposed to do legally.&#10;&#10;I purchased the car off a man 3 weeks ago for £17,000. It was £18,000 but he knocked £1000 off when he couldn't find the log book while I was there. He was returning to his home country and didn't need the car anymore.&#10;&#10;He had lost the V5C, so I applied for a new one with a V62 form. I understand that I am not allowed to drive this car on the roads until it is properly taxed so it has been sitting in my driveway.&#10;&#10;I notified the DVLA with the V62 form requesting a new V5C. However, I have now been reached out to by the Motorbility group who state the car belongs to them and the guy who sold it to me had no right to actually sell this car.&#10;&#10;Can I get some advice? Do I have to return the car when they come to collect it today? I bought it in good faith. Is the issue not between Motorbility and the man who sold their car?"

    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a short but helpful reply you could adapt for the Redditor\u0027s post, focusing on their immediate options:\n\n\u0022Legally, this is tricky. Since the seller didn\u0027t own the car, you likely don\u0027t have valid title to it, even though you bought it in good faith. You probably will have to return the car to Motability.\n\nHowever, you *are* entitled to get your \u00A317,000 back from the seller. This might involve legal action against him, even if he\u0027s out of the country. Gather all your evidence of the sale (receipt, communications, etc.).\n\nContact a solicitor ASAP to discuss your options for recovering your money. Citizens Advice can also offer initial guidance. Don\u0027t just hand over the car without getting legal advice first!\u0022\n",
    "Grok": "Sorry to hear about this mess\u2014sounds like a classic case of \u0022buyer beware\u0022 gone wrong. Legally (under UK law like the Sale of Goods Act and Consumer Rights Act), in a private sale, you only get good title if the seller had it to give. Since this was a Motability lease (they own it outright, and lessees can\u0027t sell), the guy committed fraud by offloading it. You\u0027re not the legal owner, so Motability can reclaim it\u2014no \u0022good faith\u0022 defense against the true owner here.\n\n**What to do now (short-term):**\n- **Don\u0027t hand it over today.** Lock it up and tell them you\u0027re seeking urgent legal advice. If they try to take it forcefully, call the police\u2014it\u0027s on your property.\n- **Contact a solicitor ASAP** (free initial advice via Citizens Advice or Law Society finder). You might have a claim against the seller for misrepresentation/fraud to get your \u00A317k back (track him down via his details or police report).\n- **Report to police:** This could be theft by deception. Also notify DVLA to halt your V5C application.\n- **Chase Motability:** Ask if they\u0027ll compensate you as an innocent buyer (unlikely, but worth a shot\u2014 they\u0027ve got policies on this).\n\nLong-term, private sales carry risks; next time, check HPI or similar for finance/lease flags. Hang in there\u2014get pro advice today to protect your cash. Sources: Motability FAQs and UK consumer law guides.",
    "ChatGPT": "Unfortunately, since the car was leased and not legally sold to you, the lease company (Motorbility) retains ownership. Even though you bought in good faith, you likely must return it. Your best move is to seek legal advice to explore recovering your \u00A317k from the seller, who committed fraud. Keep all documents and communication safe."
