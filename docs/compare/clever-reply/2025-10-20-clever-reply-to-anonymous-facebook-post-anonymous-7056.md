  prompt="clever reply to Anonymous Facebook post: Anonymous participant&#10;17 October at 03:19&#10;  ·&#10;State of TX&#10;If parent A fabricated a lie to the cusody evaluator pertaining domestic violence taking place from parent  B during relationship prior to divorce, after final custody modification hearing has taken place can parent B file separate law suit for slander (or whatever the correct legal terminology is for this) to have this corrected as parent B is concerned there is now a report that has  damaging statements documented that are untrue?"
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "A clever reply could be:\n\n\u0022Sounds like Parent B might have a real \u2018story\u2019 to tell\u2014but hopefully one with better evidence! In all seriousness, if false statements were made and documented, a defamation claim could be on the table. But navigating custody and legal battles is tricky\u2014best to chat with a Texas family law attorney who can separate fact from fiction and help clear the record!\u0022",
    "Grok": "I\u0027m not a lawyer, but as a fellow Texan who\u0027s seen enough courtroom drama to rival a Netflix series, here\u0027s the scoop: What Parent B is dealing with sounds like potential **defamation** (slander if spoken, libel if written), especially if it\u0027s false and damaging to their reputation or custody standing. However, those custody evaluator reports are often shielded by \u0022judicial privilege\u0022 in Texas\u2014meaning statements made during the legal process (like to an evaluator) can\u0027t easily be sued over, even if they\u0027re lies. It\u0027s like the court\u0027s \u0022do not disturb\u0022 sign for messy family fights.\n\nPost-final hearing, Parent B *might* have a shot at a separate civil suit for defamation or even malicious prosecution if they can prove the lies were intentional and outside protected proceedings, but it\u0027s an uphill battle. The report itself? Tough to \u0022correct\u0022 after the fact without reopening the case or filing a motion to modify based on fraud.\n\nBest move: Consult a family law attorney ASAP (try the State Bar of Texas referral service). They can review the specifics and see if it\u0027s worth pursuing\u2014don\u0027t let those false flags fly unchecked! \uD83D\uDCAA #TexasFamilyLaw #FalseAccusations",
    "Gemini": "Here\u0027s some information regarding your question about pursuing legal action for false statements made during a custody evaluation in Texas:\n\nIt appears you\u0027re asking if Parent B can sue Parent A for slander (or a similar claim) if Parent A lied to a custody evaluator about domestic violence, after a custody modification hearing has already taken place. Parent B is concerned about the untrue statements in the resulting report.\n\nHere\u0027s a breakdown of potential legal avenues and considerations:\n\n*   **Defamation:** Slander (spoken) and libel (written) are types of defamation. To prove defamation, Parent B generally needs to show that Parent A made a false statement of fact, that the statement was published to a third party (the custody evaluator), that the statement was defamatory, and that Parent B was damaged as a result.\n*   **Perjury:** If Parent A made false statements under oath during a hearing, that could potentially be perjury.\n*   **Impact of the Custody Evaluation:** The fact that the false statement is now part of a documented report from the custody evaluator is significant. This report could influence future custody decisions.\n*   **Texas Law:** You\u0027d need to consult with a Texas attorney to determine the specific laws and legal precedents that would apply to your situation. They can advise you on the strength of your case and the best course of action.\n*   **Statute of Limitations:** There\u0027s a time limit (statute of limitations) for filing lawsuits, so it\u0027s important to act promptly.\n\nTo provide you with a more tailored and accurate response, I need to know whether the statements were made during testimony in court or outside of court.\n\n"
