    "ChatGPT": "\u0022Guess that makes me the AI-generated disappointment\u2014you win some, you lose some!\u0022",
    "Grok": "Guilty as charged? Nah, this one\u0027s all me\u2014fingers on the keyboard, coffee in hand, zero prompts involved. But if you spot an AI ghost in my future replies, feel free to haunt me back. \uD83D\uDE0F",
    "Gemini": "To formulate a clever reply, I need to understand the tone and context of Arvid\u0027s post. Is he being serious, humorous, or provocative? Here are a few options, ranging from agreeing to sarcastic:\n\n**Replies that align with Arvid\u0027s sentiment:**\n\n*   \u0022Valid. It\u0027s like they\u0027re outsourcing their personality.\u0022\n*   \u0022It\u0027s the intellectual equivalent of regifting a fruitcake.\u0022\n*   \u0022Same. Shows a lack of original thought and engagement.\u0022\n\n**Replies that are sarcastic or humorous:**\n\n*   \u0022So you\u0027re saying AI is ruining your parasocial relationships?\u0022\n*   \u0022Guess I\u0027ll have to start writing my own replies... darn.\u0022\n*   \u0022That\u0027s why I have my AI write *original* replies.\u0022\n*   \u0022I understand. It\u0027s hard to compete with the wit and charm of a bot.\u0022\n\nTo give you the *best* reply, tell me:\n\n*   **What kind of tone do you want to strike?** (Serious, funny, sarcastic, etc.)\n*   **What is Arvid known for?** (e.g., Is he a tech enthusiast, a writer, a comedian?) This will help tailor the response.\n\nI will generate some search queries to get more information about Arvid, and current trends on X.\n\n"
