    "Mistral": "Creating a budget plan for a 25-year-old making $75,000 per year who wants to buy a house in 3 years involves several steps. Here\u2019s a comprehensive plan to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Step 1: Determine Monthly Income\n- **Annual Income:** $75,000\n- **Monthly Income:** $75,000 / 12 = $6,250\n\n### Step 2: Estimate Monthly Expenses\n1. **Housing:**\n   - Rent: $1,500\n   - Utilities (electricity, water, internet): $200\n   - Total: $1,700\n\n2. **Transportation:**\n   - Car payment: $300\n   - Car insurance: $100\n   - Gas: $150\n   - Maintenance: $50\n   - Total: $600\n\n3. **Food:**\n   - Groceries: $300\n   - Dining out: $200\n   - Total: $500\n\n4. **Health:**\n   - Health insurance: $200\n   - Medical expenses: $50\n   - Total: $250\n\n5. **Savings and Investments:**\n   - Emergency fund: $200\n   - Retirement savings (401k, IRA): $500\n   - Total: $700\n\n6. **Personal and Discretionary:**\n   - Entertainment: $200\n   - Clothing: $100\n   - Gym/Fitness: $50\n   - Miscellaneous: $100\n   - Total: $450\n\n7. **Debt Repayment:**\n   - Student loans: $300\n   - Credit card payments: $100\n   - Total: $400\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Expenses\n- **Total Monthly Expenses:** $1,700 (Housing) \u002B $600 (Transportation) \u002B $500 (Food) \u002B $250 (Health) \u002B $700 (Savings) \u002B $450 (Personal) \u002B $400 (Debt) = $4,600\n\n### Step 4: Determine Savings for House Down Payment\n- **Monthly Savings for House:** $6,250 (Monthly Income) - $4,600 (Monthly Expenses) = $1,650\n\n### Step 5: Set a Savings Goal for the Down Payment\n- **Desired Down Payment:** 20% of the house price\n- **Estimated House Price:** $300,000 (This can vary based on location and market conditions)\n- **Down Payment Needed:** $300,000 * 20% = $60,000\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Monthly Savings Needed\n- **Total Savings Needed in 3 Years:** $60,000\n- **Monthly Savings Needed:** $60,000 / 36 months = $1,667\n\n### Step 7: Adjust Budget to Meet Savings Goal\n- **Current Monthly Savings:** $1,650\n- **Additional Savings Needed:** $1,667 - $1,650 = $17\n\n### Step 8: Review and Adjust Expenses\nTo meet the savings goal, consider the following adjustments:\n1. **Reduce Dining Out:** Cut from $200 to $150 (Save $50/month)\n2. **Reduce Entertainment:** Cut from $200 to $150 (Save $50/month)\n3. **Reduce Miscellaneous:** Cut from $100 to $50 (Save $50/month)\n\n### Step 9: Final Budget Plan\n- **Adjusted Monthly Expenses:** $4,450\n- **Adjusted Monthly Savings:** $6,250 - $4,450 = $1,800\n\n### Step 10: Monitor and Adjust\n- **Regularly Review:** Check your budget monthly to ensure you are on track.\n- **Adjust as Needed:** Make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.\n\n### Summary\n- **Monthly Income:** $6,250\n- **Monthly Expenses:** $4,450\n- **Monthly Savings for House:** $1,800\n- **Total Savings in 3 Years:** $1,800 * 36 = $64,800\n\nBy following this budget plan, you should be able to save enough for a down payment on a house within 3 years.",

    "Grok": "Creating a budget plan for a 25-year-old earning $75,000 annually who wants to buy a house in 3 years involves careful financial planning to save for a down payment, manage expenses, and maintain a good credit score. Below is a detailed budget plan tailored to this goal.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Assess Income and Goals\n- **Annual Income**: $75,000\n- **Monthly Income (after taxes)**: Assuming a federal tax rate of ~22%, state taxes (if applicable, assuming 5%), and other deductions (Social Security, Medicare, etc.), the take-home pay is approximately **$58,000 per year** or **$4,833 per month**. This can vary depending on location and specific tax brackets, so adjust accordingly using a paycheck calculator.\n- **House Goal**: Save for a down payment on a house in 3 years. For a house in the range of $300,000 (adjust based on location), a 20% down payment would be **$60,000** (to avoid PMI, private mortgage insurance). This means saving **$20,000 per year** or **$1,667 per month**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Budget Overview\nWe will use the **50/30/20 rule** as a starting point (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/debt repayment), but adjust it to prioritize saving for the down payment. Since saving $1,667/month is critical, we\u2019ll aim for a higher savings rate (closer to 35-40%).\n\n#### Monthly Budget Breakdown\n- **Total Monthly Income**: $4,833\n- **Target Savings for Down Payment**: $1,667 (35% of income)\n- **Remaining for Expenses**: $3,166\n\nHere\u2019s the detailed budget based on needs, wants, and savings/debt repayment:\n\n| **Category**              | **Percentage** | **Monthly Amount** | **Notes**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Needs (Essentials)**    | 40%            | $1,933            | Rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, minimum debt payments |\n| **Wants (Discretionary)** | 25%            | $1,208            | Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, travel, non-essential shopping        |\n| **Savings/Debt Repayment**| 35%            | $1,692            | Down payment savings \u002B extra debt repayment (if applicable)              |\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Expense Breakdown\n#### Needs ($1,933/month)\n- **Rent/Housing**: $1,200 (adjust based on location; consider roommates to lower this cost if possible)\n- **Utilities (electricity, water, internet)**: $150\n- **Groceries**: $300\n- **Transportation**: $200 (fuel, public transit, or car maintenance; adjust if you own a car)\n- **Health Insurance/Expenses**: $100 (if not covered by employer)\n- **Minimum Debt Payments**: $0 (assumed no debt for now; adjust if student loans, credit card debt, etc., exist)\n\n#### Wants ($1,208/month)\n- **Dining Out**: $200\n- **Entertainment (streaming, movies, etc.)**: $50\n- **Hobbies/Recreation**: $100\n- **Travel/Vacation Fund**: $150\n- **Non-Essential Shopping**: $100\n- **Miscellaneous/Buffer**: $608 (flexible for unexpected small expenses or additional savings)\n\n#### Savings/Debt Repayment ($1,692/month)\n- **Down Payment Savings**: $1,667\n- **Emergency Fund or Extra Debt Repayment**: $25 (start small if no emergency fund exists; aim to build 3-6 months of expenses over time)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Additional Financial Strategies\n1. **Build an Emergency Fund First**: If you don\u2019t already have one, allocate part of your savings in the first few months to build a small emergency fund (e.g., $1,000-$3,000) before fully focusing on the down payment. This prevents dipping into savings for unexpected costs.\n2. **Cut Costs Where Possible**:\n   - Reduce rent by living with roommates or in a cheaper area.\n   - Limit dining out and cook at home.\n   - Use public transportation or carpool to save on fuel.\n   - Cancel unused subscriptions.\n3. **Increase Income**:\n   - Consider a side hustle (freelancing, tutoring, gig work) to boost savings.\n   - Invest in skills or certifications for a raise or better job within the 3-year timeline.\n4. **High-Yield Savings Account**: Store down payment savings in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) with an interest rate of 4-5% (as of 2023 rates) to earn passive income on your savings. For example, $20,000 saved annually at 4% APY could earn ~$800 in interest over 3 years.\n5. **Maintain/Improve Credit Score**: A good credit score (700\u002B) will secure better mortgage rates. Pay all bills on time, keep credit card utilization below 30%, and avoid new debt.\n6. **Debt Management**: If you have debt, focus on paying off high-interest debt (credit cards) first while making minimum payments on low-interest debt (student loans). Adjust the budget to allocate more to debt repayment if needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: 3-Year Savings Projection\n- **Monthly Savings for Down Payment**: $1,667\n- **Annual Savings**: $1,667 x 12 = $20,004\n- **Total After 3 Years (without interest)**: $20,004 x 3 = $60,012\n- **Total After 3 Years (with 4% APY, compounded monthly)**: Approximately $61,800 (use a compound interest calculator for exact figures based on the account).\n\nThis meets the $60,000 down payment goal for a $300,000 house. If housing prices are higher in your area, adjust the savings goal or timeline accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Monthly Budget Summary\n| **Category**              | **Amount**  |\n|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Needs                     | $1,933      |\n| Wants                     | $1,208      |\n| Savings/Debt Repayment    | $1,692      |\n| **Total**                 | $4,833      |\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Monitor and Adjust\n- **Track Spending**: Use budgeting apps like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or a simple spreadsheet to monitor expenses monthly.\n- **Adjust as Needed**: If unexpected expenses arise or income changes, revisit the budget to reallocate funds without derailing the savings goal.\n- **Annual Review**: Assess progress yearly to ensure you\u2019re on track for the $60,000 down payment.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Housing Market Research**: Start researching the housing market in your desired area now to understand price trends and set a realistic savings goal.\n- **First-Time Homebuyer Programs**: Look into programs in your state or city that offer down payment assistance or lower interest rates for first-time buyers.\n- **Closing Costs**: Save an additional 2-5% of the house price ($6,000-$15,000 for a $300,000 house) for closing costs, which can be saved separately or added to the monthly goal.\n- **Lifestyle Balance**: While saving aggressively, don\u2019t deprive yourself completely\u2014allocate funds for enjoyment to avoid burnout.\n\nThis budget plan provides a structured path to save $60,000\u002B for a house down payment in 3 years while maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Adjust the numbers based on your specific circumstances, such as location, debts, or income changes."
