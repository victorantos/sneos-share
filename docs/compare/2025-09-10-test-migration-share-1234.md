# Test Migration Share

## Prompt
> What is the best way to test a share migration?

## ChatGPT

To test a share migration, you should verify that the content appears correctly on the new domain and that all links work properly. Start by creating a test share, then check if it publishes to the new location, and finally verify that the redirect mechanisms function as expected.

## Claude

Testing a share migration involves checking the deployment pipeline, verifying the content is accessible, and confirming the redirect mechanisms work as expected. You should test both the immediate blob storage version and the permanent VuePress-generated pages.

## Gemini

For testing share migration, ensure the new subdomain works, content is properly formatted, and the publishing workflow functions correctly. Test the complete flow from share creation to final publication.
