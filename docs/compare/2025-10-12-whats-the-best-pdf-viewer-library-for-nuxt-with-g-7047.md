  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "For Nuxt (Vue.js) projects, if you are looking for a PDF viewer library that offers great UX, good performance, supports both web and mobile, and importantly **does not require copying or manually handling the PDF worker (like pdf.js\u0027s copy-pdf-worker)**, your options are somewhat limited but here are the best recommendations:\n\n### 1. **pdfviewer.js (or vue-pdf-viewer)**\n- **Description:** Some lightweight Vue wrappers around PDF.js that abstract away worker setup.\n- **Pros:** Often simpler to integrate, fewer manual configurations.\n- **Cons:** Some wrappers still indirectly use PDF.js worker and might require build-time tweaks.\n\n### 2. **PDF.js Express (by PDFTron)**\n- **Website:** https://pdfjs.express/\n- **Description:** A commercial PDF viewer built on PDF.js but doesn\u0027t require users to manage worker files manually. It offers a fully-featured viewer with annotations, form filling, etc.\n- **Pros:**\n  - No need to manually copy or configure pdf.worker.js.\n  - Good performance and UX.\n  - Supports mobile (responsive).\n  - Comprehensive feature set.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Commercial license (free tier available with some limitations).\n  - Slightly bigger bundle size.\n\n### 3. **PSPDFKit (paid)**\n- **Website:** https://pspdfkit.com/\n- **Description:** Highly polished commercial PDF SDK for web and mobile with first-class support for Vue/Nuxt.\n- **Pros:** \n  - Native-like performance and UX.\n  - Complete PDF toolkit (viewing, editing, annotations).\n  - Handles worker setup internally.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Expensive.\n  - Commercial.\n\n### 4. **native HTML \u0060\u003Cembed\u003E\u0060 or \u0060\u003Ciframe\u003E\u0060 for basic needs**\n- If your use case is basic viewing and you want zero dependencies or worker configurations, you can use native embedding (limited UX and features).\n\n---\n\n### Summary recommendation:\n- **If you want open-source with minimal fuss and no manual worker setup:** Look for lighter Vue PDF wrappers like \u0060vue-pdf\u0060 but verify worker handling for your build.\n- **If you want excellent UX, performance, and full features without copy-pdf-worker hassle:** **PDF.js Express** is probably the best balance of ease-of-use and features.\n- **If budget is not an issue and you want premium experience:** PSPDFKit is excellent.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation tip for PDF.js Express in Nuxt:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\nnpm install @pdftron/pdfjs-express\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060vue\n\u003Ctemplate\u003E\n  \u003Cdiv id=\u0022viewer\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/template\u003E\n\n\u003Cscript setup\u003E\nimport { WebViewer } from \u0027@pdftron/pdfjs-express\u0027;\n\nonMounted(() =\u003E {\n  WebViewer(\n    {\n      path: \u0027/webviewer/lib\u0027, // path to the PDF.js Express lib folder\n      initialDoc: \u0027/path/to/your/document.pdf\u0027,\n    },\n    document.getElementById(\u0027viewer\u0027)\n  ).then((instance) =\u003E {\n    // Customizations can go here\n  });\n});\n\u003C/script\u003E\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nPDF.js Express bundles its own worker internally, so no need to handle that step.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to help you with code examples or integration specific to your project setup, just ask!",
    "Grok": "Based on recent developments in the Vue/Nuxt ecosystem (as of 2025), the best PDF viewer library that aligns with your criteria\u2014great user experience (UX), strong performance, seamless support for both web and mobile, and no need for manual handling of worker scripts like copy-pdf-worker\u2014is **@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer**. It\u0027s specifically designed for Vue.js and Nuxt applications, making it a natural fit without the build complications that plague some PDF.js-based alternatives (e.g., no required worker file copying or SSR conflicts in Nuxt).\n\n### Why @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer?\n- **Great UX**: It provides a modern, customizable interface with features like zoom, pagination, search, thumbnails, and responsive layouts. You can easily theme it to match your app\u0027s design, and it supports annotations, text selection, and printing for an intuitive experience.\n- **Good Performance**: Built on PDF.js under the hood but optimized for Vue/Nuxt, it handles large PDFs efficiently with lazy loading and hardware-accelerated rendering. It avoids heavy initial loads and performs well on lower-end devices.\n- **Web and Mobile Support**: Fully responsive and touch-friendly, it works out-of-the-box on desktops, tablets, and mobiles (including iOS Safari and Android Chrome). No extra plugins needed for gestures like pinch-to-zoom.\n- **No copy-pdf-worker Hassle**: Unlike raw PDF.js or some wrappers (e.g., vue-pdf-embed), this library abstracts away worker management. It uses a bundled approach that integrates cleanly with Nuxt\u0027s build process, avoiding manual asset copying or Vite/Webpack tweaks.\n- **Nuxt Integration**: Easy to set up as a composable or component in Nuxt 3\u002B. It\u0027s actively maintained (latest version 3.1.1 as of late 2025) and has excellent TypeScript support.\n\n#### Quick Setup in Nuxt 3\n1. Install via npm:\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060\n   npm install @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n2. In your \u0060nuxt.config.ts\u0060, add it as a module if needed (though it\u0027s mostly plug-and-play):\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060ts\n   export default defineNuxtConfig({\n     modules: [\u0027@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer/nuxt\u0027], // Optional for auto-imports\n   })\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n3. Use in a page or component (e.g., \u0060pages/pdf-viewer.vue\u0060):\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060vue\n   \u003Ctemplate\u003E\n     \u003Cdiv\u003E\n       \u003CVuePdfViewer\n         :src=\u0022pdfUrl\u0022\n         :page=\u00221\u0022\n         :scale=\u00221.0\u0022\n         :stick-to-page=\u0022false\u0022\n         @page-loaded=\u0022onPageLoaded\u0022\n       /\u003E\n     \u003C/div\u003E\n   \u003C/template\u003E\n\n   \u003Cscript setup lang=\u0022ts\u0022\u003E\n   import { VuePdfViewer } from \u0027@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer\u0027\n   const pdfUrl = \u0027/path/to/your/document.pdf\u0027 // Or a remote URL\n\n   const onPageLoaded = (e: any) =\u003E {\n     console.log(\u0027Page loaded:\u0027, e.pageNumber)\n   }\n   \u003C/script\u003E\n   \u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n4. For assets: Place static PDFs in your \u0060public/\u0060 folder or fetch dynamically. It handles both local files and URLs securely.\n\nThis setup renders PDFs client-side (use \u0060\u003CClientOnly\u003E\u0060 in Nuxt if SSR issues arise, though it\u0027s rare). For production, enable PDF.js worker optimizations via config props for even better perf.\n\n### Alternatives If It Doesn\u0027t Fit\nIf you need more advanced enterprise features (e.g., redaction, digital signatures, or Office file support alongside PDFs), consider **Apryse WebViewer** (formerly PDFTron). It\u0027s a premium option with exceptional UX and mobile optimization, no worker copying required, and a dedicated Nuxt guide. However, it\u0027s not free for commercial use (starts at ~$500/year) and is overkill for simple viewing.\n\n- Avoid: Raw PDF.js or vue-pdf, as they often require manual worker setup in Nuxt builds, leading to the copy-pdf-worker issues you\u0027re dodging.\n\nFor more details, check the official npm page for @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer or recent guides like \u0022Launch a PDF Viewer in Nuxt Using @vue-pdf-viewer\u0022 on DEV Community (updated for 2025). If your use case has specific needs (e.g., annotations or accessibility), let me know for tailored advice!",
    "Gemini": "For a Nuxt PDF viewer library that offers great UX, good performance, and supports both web and mobile without requiring \u0060copy-pdf-worker\u0060, here\u0027s a breakdown of your options:\n\n**1. @vue-pdf-viewer**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Built specifically for Vue and Nuxt, minimizing compatibility issues.\n    *   Lightweight, contributing to good performance.\n    *   Feature-rich with smooth zoom/rotation, keyboard navigation, responsive layouts, PDF layers support, and text search/selection.\n    *   Easy to integrate into Nuxt projects.\n    *   Allows customization of the UI and branding.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   May require a paid license for full use in Nuxt apps.\n    *   No SSR (Server-Side Rendering) support.\n\n**2. PDF.js**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   A popular open-source library developed by Mozilla.\n    *   Renders PDFs using HTML5 and JavaScript.\n    *   Lightweight and client-side driven.\n    *   Highly customizable.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   Requires more investment in custom UI and handling complexity.\n\n**3. react-pdf**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Uses PDF.js for parsing and rendering.\n    *   Component-based rendering.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   Lacks an out-of-the-box UI, so you\u0027ll need to build your own reader interface.\n    *   Relies on PDF.js, so any vulnerabilities in PDF.js will impact react-pdf as well.\n\n**4. Nutrient Web SDK**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Offers a customizable and responsive PDF viewer.\n    *   Supports PDF, PDF/A, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, TIFF, PNG, and JPG file types.\n    *   Compatible with all modern browsers.\n*   Key Features:\n    *   Customizable UI.\n    *   Client-side PDF rendering.\n    *   Mobile-friendly PDF viewer.\n    *   Accessibility features.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   It is a commercial SDK.\n\n**5. @i2d/nuxt-pdf-frame**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Enables rendering of PDF and Canvas graphics within Nuxt applications.\n    *   Uses a template-based syntax.\n    *   SVG-like syntax.\n    *   Consistent rendering for both PDF and Canvas outputs.\n    *   Multi-page support.\n\n**Regarding \u0060copy-pdf-worker\u0060:**\n\nSome libraries, like \u0060react-pdf\u0060, may require you to manually copy the \u0060pdf.worker.mjs\u0060 file to your project\u0027s public directory. However, \u0060PDF.js\u0060 offers a way to include the worker via CDN, which might be a suitable alternative.\n"
