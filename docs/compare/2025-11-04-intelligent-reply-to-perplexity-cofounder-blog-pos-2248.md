  prompt="intelligent reply to Perplexity cofounder blog post: Bullying is Not Innovation&#10;The point of technology is to make life better for people. We call it innovation, but it’s just the constant process of asking how to make things better. Bullying, on the other hand, is when large corporations use legal threats and intimidation to block innovation and make life worse for people. &#10;This week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon’s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users.&#10;For the last 50 years, software has been a tool, like a wrench in the hands of the user. But with the rise of agentic AI, software is also becoming labor: an assistant, an employee, an agent.&#10;The law is clear that large corporations have no right to stop you from owning wrenches. Today, Amazon announced it does not believe in your right to hire labor, to have an assistant or an employee acting on your behalf.  This isn’t a reasonable legal position, it’s a bully tactic to scare disruptive companies like Perplexity out of making life better for people. &#10;A Threat to User Choice&#10;Amazon wants to block you from using your own AI assistant to shop on their platform. Here's what they're trying to prevent: You ask your Comet Assistant to find and purchase something on Amazon. If you're logged in to Amazon (credentials in Comet are stored securely only in your device, never on Perplexity’s servers), the Comet Assistant quickly finds and purchases the item for you, saving you time for more important tasks. Or, you can ask it to compare options and purchase the best one for your needs. Comet users love this experience.&#10;Amazon should love this. Easier shopping means more transactions and happier customers. But Amazon doesn’t care. They’re more interested in serving you ads, sponsored results, and influencing your purchasing decisions with upsells and confusing offers. &#10;How do we know? CEO Andy Jassy told investors just last week: &quot;It just all leads to a return on advertising spend that's very unusual,” he bragged (47:50), and in the same call he admitted, “We’re also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with 3rd party agents.” (41:38). &#10;Read that again. Amazon wants to eliminate user rights so that it can sell more ads right now and partner with AI agents designed to take advantage of users later. It’s not just bullying, it’s bonkers. &#10;Every retailer should celebrate the art and science of merchandising, which is when merchants create delightful customer experiences in the shopping journey. But it’s dangerous to confuse consumer experience with consumer exploitation. Users want AI they can trust, and they want AI Assistants that work on their behalf and no one else’s. &#10;The Future of User Agents&#10;User agents are exactly that: agents of the user.  They're distinct from crawlers, scrapers, or bots. A user agent is your AI assistant—it has exactly the same permissions you have, works only at your specific request, and acts solely on your behalf.&#10;Assistive AI is becoming an increasingly important aspect of the global economy, businesses everywhere, and the individual rights and capabilities of every person. We believe it’s crucial to raise awareness about the issues facing user agents.&#10;For user agents to serve their true purpose, they must be:&#10;1. Private. Your AI assistant must be indistinguishable from you. When Comet Assistant visits a website, it does so with your credentials, your permissions, and your rights. (It’s also unable to do anything you can’t). Publishers and corporations have no right to discriminate against users based on which AI they've chosen to represent them. Users must have the right to choose technologies that represent them. Privacy and freedom of choice depend on this.&#10;2. Personal. Your user agent works for you, not for Perplexity, and certainly not for Amazon. For decades, machine learning and algorithms have been weapons in the hands of large corporations, deployed to serve ads and manipulate what you see, experience, and purchase. The transformative promise of LLMs is that they put power back in the hands of people. Agentic AI marks a meaningful shift: users can finally regain control of their online experiences.&#10;3. Powerful. Your AI assistant must be capable of any task that matters to you. Users have a right to select high-performing AI agents from the cutting edge of innovation. The technology available to users can’t be hamstrung just because it threatens some public company’s pressure to deliver more ad revenue. The future of AI, like all technology, is for people. &#10;Perplexity Will Not Be Intimidated&#10;The rise of agentic AI presents a choice. Will this technology empower users to take control of their digital lives? Or will it become another tool for corporations to manipulate and exploit?&#10;Perplexity is fighting for the rights of users. People love our products because they’re designed for people. User choice and freedom are at the heart of everything we build. &#10;Perhaps that’s what makes us a target for corporate bullies. But Amazon shouldn’t forget what it’s like to be our size and passionate about a world-changing product. They too once faced intimidating threats and fought aggressively in every case to give users a better choice.&#10;Amazon also forgets how it got so big. Users love it. They want good products, at a low price, delivered fast. Agentic shopping is the natural evolution of this promise, and people already demand it. Perplexity demands the right to offer it."

    "ChatGPT": "Thank you for sharing this thoughtful and timely perspective. Your articulation of the distinction between true innovation and corporate bullying highlights a critical challenge at the intersection of technology, user rights, and market power. \n\nThe vision of agentic AI as \u201Clabor\u201D entrusted to users \u2014 personal, private, and powerful assistants working on their behalf \u2014 is both inspiring and essential for empowering individuals in today\u2019s digital economy. Your emphasis on user choice and control strikes at the core of what technology should be: a tool to enhance human agency, not restrict it in the interest of corporate profit or advertising dominance.\n\nAmazon\u2019s legal threats against Perplexity set a concerning precedent that risks undermining the fundamental freedoms users have come to expect online: the right to employ tools of their choice to streamline and improve life. By conflating user agents with exploitative bots and suppressing innovation that challenges their ad-driven model, Amazon appears to prioritize short-term gain over long-term user experience and market fairness.\n\nThis conflict underscores the urgent need for clear legal frameworks that recognize user agents as legitimate extensions of users themselves \u2014 acting with their authorization, on their behalf, without discrimination or interference. The future of AI must be about restoring balance, transparency, and trust in digital interactions.\n\nPerplexity\u2019s courageous stance is a vital contribution to this debate \u2014 reminding us that innovation thrives only in an environment where bold ideas are welcomed, not stifled by intimidation. I stand with your call to protect user freedom and celebrate technology that truly serves people. Together, we must ensure the next chapter of AI empowers users rather than entraps them.",
    "Grok": "### Empowering Users: Why User Agents Are the Next Frontier in Digital Freedom\n\nThank you for this insightful and timely post, [Cofounder\u0027s Name or \u0022Perplexity Team\u0022]. Your framing of agentic AI as \u0022labor\u0022 rather than just \u0022tools\u0022 is a powerful metaphor that cuts through the noise. It reminds us that technology\u0027s true north should always be human empowerment, not corporate gatekeeping. Amazon\u0027s legal threat against Comet isn\u0027t just an attack on Perplexity\u2014it\u0027s a shot across the bow for anyone building AI that hands control back to users.\n\nYou\u0027re spot on about the distinction between user agents and scrapers. In an era where bots and crawlers have eroded trust online, Comet\u0027s model\u2014private, personal, and powerful\u2014represents a genuine evolution. Storing credentials locally and acting solely on user intent aligns perfectly with principles of privacy and autonomy. It\u0027s frustrating to see Amazon, a company born from disrupting incumbents, now leveraging its scale to stifle that same spirit. As you noted, Jassy\u0027s recent earnings call comments highlight the tension: short-term ad revenue versus long-term user-centric innovation. Partnering with \u00223rd party agents\u0022 that serve their ecosystem sounds less like collaboration and more like controlled integration.\n\nThis isn\u0027t isolated. Recent coverage (e.g., from Reuters and CNBC) underscores how such threats could chill investment in assistive AI, limiting consumer choice at a pivotal moment. Users deserve seamless experiences, whether that\u0027s comparing deals across sites or automating routine tasks without Big Tech\u0027s veto. By standing firm, Perplexity isn\u0027t just defending its product\u2014it\u0027s advocating for a future where AI amplifies individual agency, not corporate agendas.\n\nKudos for channeling that underdog energy Amazon once embodied. Let\u0027s hope this sparks broader dialogue (and perhaps regulatory scrutiny) on user rights in the agentic age. The wrench analogy is enduring: no one owns the tools we wield, and no platform should dictate how we use them. Onward to a more open web. \n\n#UserAgents #AIEmpowerment #InnovationOverIntimidation",
    "Gemini": "Here\u0027s an intelligent reply to the Perplexity cofounder\u0027s blog post, incorporating a few different angles:\n\n**Subject: Re: Bullying is Not Innovation**\n\nTo the Perplexity Team,\n\nThank you for bringing this critical issue to light. Your post resonated deeply, and I believe it touches upon a pivotal moment in the evolution of the internet and user rights.\n\nAmazon\u0027s legal threat is indeed a stark reminder that the established tech giants may see user empowerment through AI as a threat to their existing business models. The crux of the matter, as you\u0027ve articulated, is the user\u0027s right to employ AI assistants as *agents* acting on their behalf. To frame this as a threat to their platform is a dangerous precedent.\n\nHere are a few points to consider as this situation unfolds:\n\n*   **Highlighting the Hypocrisy:** Amazon\u0027s interest in partnering with 3rd party agents [as mentioned by Jassy] while simultaneously trying to block Perplexity\u0027s Comet assistant reveals a clear agenda: control. They want to dictate which AI agents are allowed, likely favoring those that prioritize advertising revenue over user experience.\n*   **Framing the Narrative:** It\u0027s essential to keep emphasizing that this isn\u0027t just about Perplexity vs. Amazon. It\u0027s about the future of the internet, where users have the right to choose their tools and agents without corporate interference.\n*   **Calling for Industry Support:** Perplexity should actively seek support from other AI companies, privacy advocates, and even retailers who understand that empowering users ultimately benefits everyone. A united front can send a powerful message to Amazon and other corporations considering similar tactics.\n*   **Educating Users:** Many users may not fully grasp the implications of this legal battle. Perplexity can play a crucial role in educating the public about user agency, data privacy, and the importance of resisting corporate overreach.\n*   **Staying True to Principles:** Perplexity\u0027s commitment to privacy, personalization, and powerful AI is what sets it apart. Maintaining these principles, even in the face of legal pressure, will solidify its reputation as a champion of user rights.\n\nAmazon\u0027s actions could backfire spectacularly. By attempting to stifle innovation and user choice, they risk alienating their customer base and creating an opening for competitors who embrace the future of user-centric AI.\n\nKeep fighting the good fight. The future of the internet may depend on it.\n\nI\u0027d also like to do some research regarding this topic:\n"
