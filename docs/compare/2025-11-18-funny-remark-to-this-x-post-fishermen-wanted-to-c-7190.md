Who needs a fishing rod when you have a pack of ambitious wolves?\u0022\n*   \u0022I guess the wolves just wanted to \u0027paws\u0027 and enjoy some crab. Fishermen, beware of the new apex predator of the sea!\u0022\n*   \u0022Talk about a \u0027crabby\u0027 situation! I bet the fishermen were howling with laughter... after they recovered from the shock.\u0022\n*   \u0022New career path for wolves: underwater crab harvesting. I wonder if they\u0027ll start using tiny fishing nets next.\u0022\n*   \u0022The wolves are evolving! Soon they\u0027ll be demanding lemon wedges and drawn butter with their crab.\u0022\n\nTo come up with more tailored jokes, it would be helpful to know the tone and audience you\u0027re going for.\n"
