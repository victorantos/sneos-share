    "ChatGPT": "How about this funny reply:\n\n\u0022Right after I finish watching this YouTube video about when to watch YouTube!\u0022 \uD83D\uDE02\uD83D\uDCFA",
    "Grok": "\u0022Whenever I need a break from reality... so, pretty much all the time! When are you watching?\u0022",
    "Gemini": "To formulate a clever and funny reply, I need a bit more context! Could you clarify the original YouTube x post? Knowing the content or subject of that post will help me tailor a witty response about when someone is watching YouTube. For example, is it a post about:\n\n*   **A specific video or channel?**\n*   **YouTube as a platform in general?**\n*   **A current event or meme related to YouTube?**\n\nIn the meantime, here are a couple of general options:\n\n*   \u0022When am I watching YouTube? Is never an option?\u0022\n*   \u0022I watch YouTube when I should be doing literally anything else.\u0022\n\nTo give you the best response, I need more information.\n"
