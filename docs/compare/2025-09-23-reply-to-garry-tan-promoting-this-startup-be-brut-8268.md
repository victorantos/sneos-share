  prompt="reply to Garry Tan promoting this startup, be brutally critical and honest: Every repo becomes better when Greptile is hooked up to it. You'd be surprised how much it helps."

    "ChatGPT": "Hi Garry,\n\nI appreciate your enthusiasm, but saying \u0022Every repo becomes better when Greptile is hooked up to it\u0022 feels like a massive oversimplification. Not every codebase has the same needs or pain points, and a one-size-fits-all tool risks adding unnecessary complexity or overhead rather than improving anything meaningful.\n\nYou haven\u0027t really addressed concrete measurable benefits or specific problems Greptile solves compared to existing tools. Without clear evidence or detailed use cases, the claim sounds more like marketing hype than a real productivity booster.\n\nI\u0027d be more convinced if you showed how it handles edge cases, scales with large projects, or integrates seamlessly without disrupting existing workflows. Until then, the blanket statement feels disingenuous and overpromised.\n\nRegards.",
    "Grok": "Hey Garry, I\u2019ve got to push back on this Greptile hype. Claiming \u0022every repo becomes better\u0022 with it hooked up feels like a massive overstatement. AI-driven code review tools like Greptile can be useful for catching certain bugs or inconsistencies, but they\u2019re far from a silver bullet. Many developers report that these tools often flag false positives or miss context-specific issues that human reviewers catch easily. Plus, Greptile\u2019s deep integration into a codebase raises real concerns about data privacy and security\u2014how much of a company\u2019s proprietary code is being analyzed or stored by a third party? \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the broader implications. Over-reliance on AI tools can erode developers\u2019 critical thinking and debugging skills over time. Not to mention, the startup\u2019s work culture\u2014publicly admitting to 84-hour workweeks with no work-life balance\u2014sets a toxic precedent. Is this the kind of environment we want to celebrate in tech? I\u2019m all for innovation, but the cost to workers and the potential risks don\u2019t seem to justify the blanket praise. I\u2019d be curious to hear how you address these downsides. What\u2019s your take?",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a brutally honest and critical response to Garry Tan\u0027s promotion of Greptile:\n\n\u0022Garry, with all due respect, saying \u0027every repo becomes better\u0027 with Greptile is a massive overstatement. While I appreciate the enthusiasm, let\u0027s be real. Does it *really* add value to a well-maintained, thoroughly documented project with a mature codebase? I\u0027m skeptical. I\u0027d need to see some serious, quantifiable data demonstrating significant improvements in code quality, bug reduction, or developer velocity across a *diverse* range of repositories, not just cherry-picked examples. And \u0027you\u0027d be surprised how much it helps\u0027? That sounds like marketing fluff. Show me the metrics. Otherwise, it just comes across as another tool adding complexity without a clear ROI.\u0022\n"
