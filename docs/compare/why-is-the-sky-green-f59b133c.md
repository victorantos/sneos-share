    "ChatGPT": "A green sky is often associated with severe weather, particularly thunderstorms and tornadoes. This phenomenon happens due to the scattering of light in the atmosphere. Here\u0027s a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Storm Clouds**: When a storm is brewing, especially in the case of supercell thunderstorms, the clouds may become very thick and dark. These clouds, often cumulonimbus clouds, can appear greenish when they are filled with a large amount of water and hail.\n\n2. **Light Refraction**: The green color can occur due to the way light interacts with the water droplets within the storm clouds. Sunlight passes through the cloud and is refracted, and because the storm clouds can be dense with precipitation, they can scatter the shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) while allowing the longer wavelengths (like red) to be seen, resulting in a greenish hue.\n\n3. **Hail**: The presence of hail is particularly significant. Hailstones can cause the cloud tops to reflect light in a way that emphasizes the green coloration.\n\n4. **Weather Warning**: A green sky often serves as a visual indicator of a significant weather event, such as heavy rain, hail or even the possibility of tornadoes. Meteorologists often take this as a sign to pay attention to severe weather developments.\n\nWhile a green sky can be an interesting sight, it is generally a sign that severe weather might be on the way, so it\u0027s wise to stay alert and informed if you see one.",
    "Claude": "The sky isn\u0027t green - it\u0027s typically blue during the day. The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth\u0027s atmosphere, it collides with tiny gas molecules. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it gets scattered more in all directions, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nThe sky can appear different colors at different times:\n- Blue during clear days\n- Red/orange/pink during sunrise and sunset\n- Gray during cloudy weather\n- Nearly black at night\n\nWere you perhaps thinking of a specific situation where the sky might look greenish? Sometimes during severe thunderstorms, the sky can take on a greenish tint due to the way light interacts with water and ice in storm clouds.",
    "Gemini": "The sky is **not** green. Under normal circumstances, the sky is blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This scattering effect scatters blue light from the sun more than other colors, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of scenarios where people might perceive or report a green sky:\n\n*   **Severe Thunderstorms:** The most common reason people associate a green sky with weather is due to the way sunlight interacts with the water droplets and ice crystals in severe thunderstorms, particularly those that produce large hail. When the red and yellow light from the setting sun shines through the deep blue color of a storm cloud, it can produce a greenish hue. This effect is often associated with supercell thunderstorms, which are capable of producing tornadoes, large hail, and strong winds.\n\n*   **Unusual Atmospheric Conditions:** Very rarely, unique combinations of pollutants, dust, or other particles in the atmosphere might scatter light in a way that causes a greenish tint. But this is highly unusual.\n\n*   **Perception/Memory:** Sometimes, the memory of a dramatic storm, combined with heightened awareness of weather conditions, can lead people to remember the sky as being greener than it actually was. Also, the ambient lighting conditions during a storm can sometimes trick the eye.\n\n*   **Filters/Cameras:** Cameras can sometimes misrepresent colors, especially under unusual lighting conditions. A filter on a camera can also intentionally create a green sky effect.\n\n*   **Aurora Borealis:** In very rare cases, certain auroral displays can have a greenish tint. However, these are generally at night and are very distinct from a daytime sky.\n\n**In summary:** The sky is usually blue. A green sky is typically associated with very severe storms and is due to the way sunlight filters through the storm clouds. If you see a green sky, it\u0027s important to take the possibility of severe weather seriously."
