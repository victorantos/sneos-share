  prompt="brutal critical reply to X post: Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro actually looks quite nice as well. 

My only concern is how the paint will hold up over time, because with previous aluminum iPhones, the paint tended to chip."
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "Oh please, \u201Clooks quite nice\u201D? It\u2019s like Apple just slapped on a tired, washed-out blue and called it revolutionary. And your concern about the paint chipping? That\u2019s not a \u201Cconcern,\u201D it\u2019s a guarantee. Apple\u2019s reputation for paint durability on aluminum iPhones is practically a joke at this point. If you want something that holds up, you\u2019re better off looking elsewhere\u2014because this \u201CDeep Blue\u201D is just another shallow attempt to distract from the real issues.",
    "Grok": "Hey, while the Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro does look sleek, your concern about paint durability is spot on. Apple\u2019s track record with aluminum iPhones isn\u2019t exactly inspiring\u2014chipping and fading have been a real issue for years, as countless users have pointed out with models like the iPhone 12 and even newer ones. Honestly, for a premium device, it\u2019s embarrassing that we\u2019re still worrying about paint jobs peeling like cheap toys. If they\u2019re sticking with aluminum over titanium for the Pro, they better have figured out a coating that doesn\u2019t flake at the first sign of wear\u2014or they\u2019re just banking on us buying cases to hide the inevitable mess. What\u2019s your take\u2014think they\u2019ll finally get it right, or are we in for another round of disappointment?",
    "Gemini": "Okay, I understand. You want me to act as if I\u0027m replying to an X post that says: \u0022Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro actually looks quite nice as well. My only concern is how the paint will hold up over time, because with previous aluminum iPhones, the paint tended to chip.\u0022\n\nHere are a few options for brutal critical replies:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on the color):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Deep Blue\u0022? More like \u0022Disappointment Blue.\u0022 They\u0027re really phoning it in with the color names now. And yeah, that paint\u0027s gonna look like a Dalmatian after a week in your pocket.\n\n**Option 2 (Focus on the chipping):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Looks nice until you actually, you know, *use* it. Prepare for the inevitable chipped-paint aesthetic. It\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s a *feature* of planned obsolescence!\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (General cynicism):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Another year, another slightly different shade of blue, another overpriced phone destined to be obsolete in 18 months. But hey, at least it *looks* nice... for now.\u0022\n\n**Option 4 (More technical/informed):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Deep Blue is fine, I guess, but it\u0027s still aluminum underneath. If they haven\u0027t improved the anodization process, prepare for the same chipping issues we\u0027ve seen before. Maybe invest in a skin from day one.\u0022\n\nTo provide a reply that is more tailored to your needs, can you clarify what kind of brutal criticism you\u0027re going for? For example:\n\n*   Are you trying to be funny?\n*   Are you trying to be technically accurate and point out flaws?\n*   Are you trying to be generally cynical about Apple products?\n"
