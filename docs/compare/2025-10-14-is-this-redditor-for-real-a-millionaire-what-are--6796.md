  title="Is this redditor for real a millionaire? What are ..."
  prompt="Is this redditor for real a millionaire? What are the chances from 0 to 100: No_Donut_6093&#10; &#10;Sold my first saas for 20 mil â‚¬ and retiring (AMA)&#10;&#10;The title speaks for itself. I've been a software developer for four years. In June, after visiting Google IO in Berlin, I came up with the idea of not just another service, or an agent for the sake of an agent, but a truly in-demand service (at least for me) Took a two-week vacation from my corporate, coded practically 24/7, then there was prod release, an advertising campaign on TikTok, constant bug fixing and adding features from comments on the same TikTok.&#10;&#10;Four months later, I have over 150,000 regular users, with excellent growth dynamics for new users and existing users upgrading to the Pro plan. And received an email from a huge(old) competitor about a full buyout of the app, including sources and me for a one-year contract.&#10;&#10;I agreed to be an advisor, signed the contract, and the first installment arrived today. To say it's a it career speedrun is an understatement :) my relatives don't know, gf non existent. So I'm waiting a year and then leavinf to live my best life.&#10;&#10;There is no point in advertising anything anymore, so I will answer your questions as best I can.&#10;&#10;The most important thing to know is that luck is, of course, very important, but the most important thing is your ideas."

    "Gemini": "To assess the likelihood of the redditor \u0022No_Donut_6093\u0022 being a millionaire after selling their SaaS business for 20 million euros, consider the following factors:\n\n*   **The claim:** The redditor claims to have sold their SaaS business for 20 million euros.\n*   **Income after taxes**: Depending on the tax laws in the redditor\u0027s jurisdiction, a significant portion of the 20 million euros could be lost to capital gains tax.\n*   **Spending habits**: Whether the redditor is a millionaire also depends on their spending habits and whether they have any significant debts.\n\nWithout further information, it\u0027s difficult to give a precise probability.\n\n",
    "Grok": "### Verification of No_Donut_6093\u0027s Reddit Post\n\nBased on a thorough search across Reddit (particularly r/SaaS, where similar AMA-style success stories are common), news sources, and social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), I couldn\u0027t find any independent confirmation of this specific story or the user No_Donut_6093\u0027s claims. The post describes an extraordinarily rapid success: a solo developer with just four years of experience building a SaaS from an idea sparked at Google I/O in Berlin (noting that Google I/O events are typically held in the US, though there have been European developer summits), launching it after a two-week coding sprint, scaling to 150,000 regular users in four months via TikTok ads, and selling it outright for \u20AC20 million (about $21.5 million USD as of current exchange rates) to a \u0022huge (old) competitor\u0022 with a one-year advisory role and initial payment already received.\n\n#### Key Red Flags and Analysis\n- **Lack of Specific Details**: The post is vague on critical elements like the SaaS\u0027s name, functionality (beyond \u0022a truly in-demand service\u0022 tied to AI/agents, possibly inspired by Google I/O themes), the competitor\u0027s identity, or verifiable metrics (e.g., no screenshots of user dashboards, revenue figures beyond \u0022upgrading to Pro,\u0022 or contract details). Real acquisition stories often leak or get buzz on platforms like Product Hunt, Hacker News, or TechCrunch, but nothing matches here.\n  \n- **Timeline and Scale Implausibility**: Achieving 150,000 users in four months as a first-time founder is rare without significant funding, viral organic growth, or prior audience. TikTok ads can drive traffic, but converting to \u0022regular users\u0022 and Pro upgrades at that speed typically requires a massive budget and polished product\u2014unlikely on a solo vacation build. For context, comparable real SaaS exits (e.g., an 18-year-old\u0027s AI health startup valued at $30M in early 2025, as reported on Decrypt) involved teams, investors, and longer timelines. Bootstrapped successes like Afforai (which hit $700K revenue in 2023 and aimed for $1M in 2024, per r/SaaS AMAs) or Curator.io ($200K MRR by 2024) took years, not months.\n\n- **No Corroborating Evidence**: \n  - Reddit searches for similar AMAs in r/SaaS turn up genuine stories (e.g., founders sharing bootstrapped paths to $1M ARR goals), but none align with this username, \u20AC20M figure, or 2025 timeline.\n  - News and web scans (e.g., for \u0022SaaS acquisition 20 million euros 2025\u0022) yield unrelated hits, like general Reddit stock predictions or smaller exits (e.g., a startup sold for $200K on Acquire.com in 2024).\n  - X posts mention indie SaaS sales (e.g., Talknotes hitting $7.5K MRR in 11 months before a modest exit), but nothing about a \u20AC20M deal or this user. Crypto-related noise (e.g., tokens like $QUIT or $RETIRE) appears tangential and unrelated.\n\n- **Common Reddit Tropes**: Posts like this often surface in startup subs as \u0022inspirational\u0022 bait for upvotes, questions, or subtle promo (though the OP claims \u0022no point in advertising\u0022). Retiring at a young age with no family/friends knowing is a classic humblebrag trope in fake success stories. If real, we\u0027d likely see follow-ups, doxxing attempts, or press by now (post date implies mid-2025).\n\n#### Chances It\u0027s Real (0-100 Scale)\nI\u0027d rate the likelihood at **15/100**. This accounts for:\n- **Positive Factors (Boosting Odds)**: SaaS is a hot space in 2025, with AI-driven tools exploding post-Google I/O influences. Quick acquisitions happen (e.g., by incumbents like established CRM or productivity giants snapping up innovators). Luck \u002B execution can lead to outliers, and \u20AC20M isn\u0027t astronomical for a high-growth app with 150K users (assuming strong retention/LTV).\n- **Negative Factors (Lowering Odds)**: Extreme rarity (most solo devs never hit this scale), zero external validation, and hallmarks of fabrication. Real millionaires from SaaS often share proof in AMAs to build cred (e.g., revenue screenshots in r/SaaS threads). Without that, it leans toward troll, bot, or exaggeration for engagement.\n\nIf this is legit, the OP might reveal more in comments\u2014check the thread for updates. For advice: Focus on verifiable paths like those in real r/SaaS AMAs (e.g., consistent building over \u0022speedruns\u0022). If you\u0027re inspired to start a SaaS, prioritize MVP validation on platforms like TikTok or Reddit before dreaming of exits! If you have more details from the thread, I can dig deeper.",
    "ChatGPT": "Based on the information provided, there are a few indicators to consider when assessing the likelihood that this redditor actually sold their SaaS product for \u20AC20 million and is genuinely a millionaire:\n\n1. **Plausibility of the story**:  \n   - The redditor claims to have developed a SaaS product very quickly (within a few months) and gained 150,000 regular users. This is aggressive but not impossible, especially with strong marketing via TikTok and a niche in-demand service.  \n   - Selling a SaaS for \u20AC20 million at that stage is rare, but not unheard of if the product is highly valuable, has strong user engagement, and fits a strategic need for a \u0022huge (old) competitor.\u0022\n\n2. **Key details that support credibility**:  \n   - The description of the process (coding intensively, TikTok marketing, user growth, buyout offer with contract) seems realistic and consistent with startup acquisition scenarios.  \n   - The redditor appears to emphasize luck and ideas, which aligns with many founder experiences.  \n   - The absence of personal details (relatives not knowing, no girlfriend) and general openness to answering questions suggest transparency.\n\n3. **Reasons for skepticism**:  \n   - No intrinsic proof (screenshots, transaction details) is presented to verify the claim.  \n   - The story aligns with a classic \u0022overnight success\u0022 narrative, which can sometimes be exaggerated for attention on social media or AMA platforms.  \n   - Selling a SaaS for \u20AC20 million after 4 months and being just a 4-year software developer is highly uncommon, though not impossible in rare cases.\n\n**Chances from 0 to 100 that this redditor is a real millionaire post-sale:**  \nGiven the above, I would estimate around **60-70%** chance they are genuine. The scenario is unusual but not implausible, and the user shares credible details that suggest authenticity. However, without verification, there\u0027s a moderate level of skepticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nWhile it\u0027s a remarkable story with a fast timeline, it\u2019s within the realm of possibility. The user could very well be a real SaaS founder who recently sold their product for a substantial amount, making them a millionaire. Nonetheless, some caution is warranted until more evidence is provided."
