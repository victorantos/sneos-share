  prompt="critic Sam Altmans blog post about abundant intelligence, reply brutally honest: Sam Altman&#10;« Back to blog&#10;Abundant Intelligence&#10;Growth in the use of AI services has been astonishing; we expect it to be even more astonishing going forward.&#10;&#10;As AI gets smarter, access to AI will be a fundamental driver of the economy, and maybe eventually something we consider a fundamental human right. Almost everyone will want more AI working on their behalf.&#10;&#10;To be able to deliver what the world needs—for inference compute to run these models, and for training compute to keep making them better and better—we are putting the groundwork in place to be able to significantly expand our ambitions for building out AI infrastructure.&#10;&#10;If AI stays on the trajectory that we think it will, then amazing things will be possible. Maybe with 10 gigawatts of compute, AI can figure out how to cure cancer. Or with 10 gigawatts of compute, AI can figure out how to provide customized tutoring to every student on earth. If we are limited by compute, we’ll have to choose which one to prioritize; no one wants to make that choice, so let’s go build.&#10;&#10;Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week. The execution of this will be extremely difficult; it will take us years to get to this milestone and it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics. But we have been hard at work on this and believe it is possible. In our opinion, it will be the coolest and most important infrastructure project ever. We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.&#10;Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality. Later this year, we’ll talk about how we are financing it; given how increasing compute is the literal key to increasing revenue, we have some interesting new ideas.&#10;"

    "ChatGPT": "Sam, your blog post on \u0022Abundant Intelligence\u0022 reads less like a visionary manifesto and more like a Silicon Valley sales pitch pumped full of buzzwords and vague promises. You repeatedly assert that AI access will become a \u0022fundamental human right\u0022 without engaging seriously with the enormous ethical, social, and geopolitical challenges that idea entails. It feels like you\u0027re trying to repackage raw compute power as a kind of techno-utopia without confronting the very real risks and inequalities your narrative conveniently glosses over.\n\nYour obsession with scaling up gigawatts of compute comes off as techno-libertarian hubris, as if sheer scale alone will miraculously solve problems like curing cancer or personalized education\u2014both of which require more than brute-force computation. There\u0027s a glaring lack of humility or nuance about what AI can actually achieve; the endless \u0022if we have more compute\u0022 conditional statements sound like wishful thinking rather than grounded strategy.\n\nAdditionally, your ambition to build this \u0022coolest infrastructure project ever\u0022 seems driven primarily by revenue and geopolitical competition, rather than any genuine commitment to societal benefit. You mention how \u0022increasing compute is the literal key to increasing revenue,\u0022 which frames this grand vision squarely as a business growth plan, not a socially responsible public good.\n\nIn summary, the post stumbles between grandiose hype and superficial tech optimism, lacking a critical examination of AI\u0027s limitations, ethical risks, or the detailed, hard work needed beyond just hardware scale-up. If you\u0027re serious about this being the future, you owe a much more realistic and accountable roadmap than this feel-good marketing memo.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a brutally honest critique of Sam Altman\u0027s \u0022Abundant Intelligence\u0022 blog post, playing the role of a harsh critic:\n\n---\n\nSam, with all due respect, this blog post reads like a Silicon Valley fever dream fueled by an unchecked ego and a disregard for real-world consequences. \u0022Abundant Intelligence\u0022? It sounds like you\u0027re trying to trademark the singularity.\n\nLet\u0027s break down the issues:\n\n*   **Grandiose Claims, Vague Substance:** You casually toss around phrases like \u0022fundamental human right\u0022 when discussing AI access. Seriously? Access to *what* kind of AI? And who decides what constitutes \u0022enough\u0022 AI to qualify as a right? This is utopian fluff, divorced from the ethical and societal complexities you conveniently ignore.\n*   **Compute as the Only Solution:** Your entire premise hinges on the idea that more compute power will magically solve all our problems \u2013 cure cancer, personalize education, etc. This is laughably simplistic. Throwing 10 gigawatts at cancer research won\u0027t guarantee a cure; it might just generate a mountain of useless data and exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare.\n*   **The \u0022Factory\u0022 Metaphor:** A \u0022factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week\u0022? This is where the post veers into self-parody. You\u0027re treating AI infrastructure like widgets, completely disregarding the environmental impact, resource depletion, and potential geopolitical ramifications of such a massive undertaking.\n*   **American Exceptionalism (Again):** The throwaway line about wanting to \u0022turn the tide\u0022 and build everything in the US is tiresome. This isn\u0027t a competition; it\u0027s a global challenge with global implications. Your focus on nationalistic pride undermines any pretense of genuine concern for humanity\u0027s future.\n*   **The Revenue-Driven Motive:** Let\u0027s be honest, this whole post boils down to one thing: making money. The promise of \u0022interesting new ideas\u0022 for financing this venture is just thinly veiled code for exploiting the AI boom for maximum profit, consequences be damned.\n\nIn short, this post is a masterclass in tech-bro hyperbole, devoid of critical thinking and ethical considerations. You\u0027re selling a dream of \u0022abundant intelligence,\u0022 but you\u0027re conveniently ignoring the potential nightmares it could unleash. Perhaps a little less \u0022build, build, build\u0022 and a little more reflection would be in order.\n\n",
    "Grok": "Sam Altman\u2019s blog post on \u0022Abundant Intelligence\u0022 presents a vision of AI as a transformative force, potentially becoming a fundamental human right and a driver of monumental societal advancements like curing cancer or providing personalized education globally. While the ambition is undeniably grand, I\u2019m going to be brutally honest in critiquing this piece, as requested. My analysis will focus on the content of the post, its assumptions, and the feasibility of the proposed infrastructure plans.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the idealism. Altman\u2019s assertion that AI could become a \u0022fundamental human right\u0022 sounds noble, but it\u2019s a massive leap that glosses over critical ethical and practical concerns. Who decides access? How do you prevent monopolistic control or exploitation by corporations like OpenAI itself? The post offers no framework for ensuring equitable distribution or addressing potential misuse of such powerful technology. It\u2019s a shiny promise without the messy details of governance, privacy, or socioeconomic disparities that inevitably arise with tech this pervasive. The lack of acknowledgment of these risks feels either naive or deliberately evasive.\n\nNext, the infrastructure vision\u2014building a factory to produce a gigawatt of AI compute capacity every week\u2014is audacious to the point of absurdity. Altman admits the execution will be \u0022extremely difficult\u0022 and take years, which is an understatement. Let\u2019s break this down: a gigawatt is a billion watts, enough to power a small city. Producing that level of compute infrastructure weekly would require not just unprecedented technological innovation across chips, power systems, and robotics, but also an astronomical amount of raw materials, energy, and capital. Recent reports suggest Altman has discussed spending trillions on AI infrastructure (as noted in sources like Bloomberg, August 15, 2025), but there\u2019s no clarity here on how this scales environmentally or logistically. What about the carbon footprint of such massive energy demands? What about the geopolitical tensions over rare earth metals for chips? The post waves away these existential challenges with a breezy \u201Clet\u2019s go build,\u201D which feels more like a motivational slogan than a serious plan.\n\nMoreover, the claim that 10 gigawatts of compute could \u201Ccure cancer\u201D or provide \u201Ccustomized tutoring to every student on earth\u201D is speculative at best, hyperbolic at worst. While AI has shown promise in medical research and education, there\u2019s no evidence that sheer compute power alone solves these problems. Cancer research, for instance, is as much about experimental biology and clinical trials as it is about data processing. Similarly, global education faces barriers of access, language, culture, and infrastructure that no amount of AI compute can magically erase. Altman\u2019s examples read like sci-fi wish fulfillment rather than grounded predictions, and they risk overpromising what AI can deliver, setting up public disillusionment when reality falls short. Given his own warnings about AI hype (as reported by Nasdaq, published 3 weeks ago), this rhetoric feels contradictory.\n\nThe focus on building infrastructure in the US also raises eyebrows. Altman frames it as a patriotic effort to counter faster progress in other countries, but this ignores the global nature of AI development. Why not collaborate internationally to share the burden and benefits of such infrastructure? The US-centric approach smells of economic nationalism, potentially alienating partners and fueling tech rivalries rather than fostering the global good he claims to champion.\n\nFinally, the post\u2019s vagueness on financing\u2014\u201Cinteresting new ideas\u201D to be revealed later\u2014is a red flag. Trillions of dollars don\u2019t materialize out of thin air. If OpenAI is banking on private investment or public funds, what are the trade-offs? Will this lead to further concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants? Altman\u2019s optimism about compute directly translating to revenue is also questionable; it assumes an endless upward trajectory for AI demand without addressing market saturation, regulatory pushback, or public skepticism about AI\u2019s societal impact.\n\nIn summary, while Altman\u2019s vision in \u0022Abundant Intelligence\u0022 is inspiring on the surface, it\u2019s riddled with oversights and overpromises. It lacks depth on ethical implications, environmental costs, and practical constraints, presenting a tech-utopian dream that feels detached from reality. Ambition is great, but without a sober reckoning of the challenges, this reads more like a PR pitch than a serious blueprint for the future. Sam, if you\u2019re going to rally the world behind such a colossal endeavor, you need to confront the hard questions head-on, not just dazzle us with gigawatts and dreams."
