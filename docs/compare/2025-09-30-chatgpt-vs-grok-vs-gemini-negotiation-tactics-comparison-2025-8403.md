    "Grok": "Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator and the author of *Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It*, has shared powerful negotiation tactics that can be applied to both high-stakes situations and everyday interactions. His techniques are grounded in empathy, active listening, and understanding human psychology. Below are some of Voss\u0027s key negotiation tactics to help you \u0022get what you want\u0022 while building trust and achieving better outcomes:\n\n### 1. **Master the Art of Tactical Empathy**\n   - **What It Is:** Tactical empathy is about understanding the emotions and perspectives of the other party and demonstrating that understanding. It\u2019s not just about agreeing with them but showing you \u0022get\u0022 where they\u2019re coming from.\n   - **How to Use It:** Listen carefully to their words, tone, and emotions. Then, articulate their feelings or position back to them to show you\u2019re on the same wavelength. For example, say, \u201CIt sounds like you\u2019re frustrated because you feel this isn\u2019t fair,\u201D or \u201CI can see why this is important to you.\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** People feel heard and understood, which lowers defenses and builds trust, making them more open to your perspective.\n\n### 2. **Use Active Listening Skills**\n   - **What It Is:** Actively listening means fully focusing on the other person without planning your response while they\u2019re speaking. Voss emphasizes techniques like mirroring, labeling, and paraphrasing.\n   - **How to Use It:**\n     - **Mirroring:** Repeat the last few words or key phrases the other person said in a curious tone. For example, if they say, \u201CI\u2019m really stressed about this deadline,\u201D you reply, \u201CStressed about the deadline?\u201D This encourages them to elaborate.\n     - **Labeling:** Name their emotions or situation. For example, \u201CIt seems like you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by this,\u201D or \u201CIt looks like you\u2019re worried about the outcome.\u201D This validates their emotions.\n     - **Paraphrasing:** Restate their position in your own words to confirm understanding. For example, \u201CSo, what you\u2019re saying is that you need more time to complete this properly?\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** These techniques show you\u2019re paying attention and care about their concerns, fostering rapport and encouraging them to share more information.\n\n### 3. **Aim for \u201CNo\u201D First**\n   - **What It Is:** Contrary to popular belief, getting a \u201Cno\u201D can be more powerful than a \u201Cyes.\u201D Voss believes that people feel safer and more in control when they say \u201Cno,\u201D and it often opens the door to a real conversation.\n   - **How to Use It:** Frame questions to elicit a \u201Cno\u201D that aligns with your goal. For example, instead of asking, \u201CDo you want to meet at 3 PM?\u201D ask, \u201CWould 3 PM be a bad time to meet?\u201D If they say \u201Cno\u201D (meaning it\u2019s not a bad time), you\u2019ve moved closer to agreement.\n   - **Why It Works:** Saying \u201Cyes\u201D can feel like a commitment, which makes people hesitant. A \u201Cno\u201D lets them feel in control while still guiding the conversation toward your desired outcome.\n\n### 4. **Anchor Their Emotions**\n   - **What It Is:** Start by addressing the other person\u2019s fears or concerns before presenting your position. This \u201Canchors\u201D the negotiation in a place of understanding.\n   - **How to Use It:** If you\u2019re asking for something (like a raise), first acknowledge potential objections or concerns. For example, \u201CI know budgets are tight, and it might seem like a tough time to ask for more compensation\u2026\u201D Then pivot to your request with a positive framing: \u201C\u2026but I\u2019ve been able to increase revenue by X% this quarter, and I\u2019d like to discuss how we can align my compensation with that value.\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** By addressing their potential objections first, you disarm resistance and show that you\u2019ve considered their perspective.\n\n### 5. **Use \u201CHow\u201D and \u201CWhat\u201D Questions to Collaborate**\n   - **What It Is:** Instead of making demands or asking yes/no questions, use open-ended \u201Chow\u201D and \u201Cwhat\u201D questions to make the other party feel like they\u2019re part of the solution.\n   - **How to Use It:** For example, instead of saying, \u201CI need this by Friday,\u201D ask, \u201CHow can we ensure this is completed by Friday?\u201D or \u201CWhat would it take for us to finalize this deal today?\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** These questions shift the dynamic from confrontation to collaboration, making the other party think creatively about solutions while subtly guiding them toward your goal.\n\n### 6. **Create the Illusion of Control**\n   - **What It Is:** People are more likely to agree if they feel they have autonomy in the negotiation. Voss suggests giving them the illusion of control while subtly directing the outcome.\n   - **How to Use It:** Offer limited choices or ask for their input in a way that aligns with your objectives. For example, instead of saying, \u201CWe\u2019re meeting at 2 PM,\u201D say, \u201CI\u2019m available at 2 PM or 3 PM\u2014 which works better for you?\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** People resist being told what to do but are more agreeable when they feel they have a say, even if the options are curated by you.\n\n### 7. **Leverage the Power of Silence**\n   - **What It Is:** After making a point or asking a question, stay silent. Don\u2019t rush to fill the void.\n   - **How to Use It:** After asking a key question like, \u201CHow can we make this work for both of us?\u201D pause and let them respond. If you\u2019ve made an offer, resist the urge to keep talking or justify it\u2014just wait.\n   - **Why It Works:** Silence is uncomfortable for most people, and they\u2019ll often feel compelled to speak, revealing more information or concessions.\n\n### 8. **Don\u2019t Split the Difference\u2014Go for a Win-Win**\n   - **What It Is:** Voss argues that \u201Csplitting the difference\u201D (meeting in the middle) often leaves both parties dissatisfied. Instead, aim for a solution where both feel they\u2019ve gained something valuable.\n   - **How to Use It:** Focus on the other party\u2019s underlying interests, not just their stated positions. If you\u2019re negotiating a price, for example, ask, \u201CWhat\u2019s most important to you in this deal?\u201D Maybe it\u2019s not the price but the terms, timing, or added value you can offer.\n   - **Why It Works:** Discovering and addressing their true priorities allows you to craft a deal that feels like a win for them without compromising your core objectives.\n\n### 9. **Use the \u201CAccusation Audit\u201D to Defuse Tension**\n   - **What It Is:** Preemptively address negative assumptions or objections the other party might have about you or your position.\n   - **How to Use It:** Start by acknowledging potential criticisms. For example, \u201CYou might think I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking for this, or that I don\u2019t understand the constraints you\u2019re under\u2026\u201D Then explain your position calmly: \u201C\u2026but here\u2019s why I believe this is fair based on the value I\u2019ve provided.\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** By vocalizing their potential objections, you neutralize them and show transparency, which reduces defensiveness and builds trust.\n\n### 10. **Know Your \u201CBlack Swans\u201D**\n   - **What It Is:** A \u201CBlack Swan\u201D is an unknown or hidden factor that can dramatically change the negotiation. Voss stresses the importance of uncovering these through active listening and curiosity.\n   - **How to Use It:** Dig deeper into the other party\u2019s motivations by asking probing questions like, \u201CWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019re facing with this?\u201D or \u201CWhat\u2019s something I might not be aware of that\u2019s influencing your decision?\u201D\n   - **Why It Works:** Uncovering hidden drivers (like personal pressures, undisclosed priorities, or external constraints) gives you leverage to adjust your approach and find a breakthrough.\n\n### Final Tips for Applying These Tactics\n- **Stay Calm and Adaptable:** Voss emphasizes maintaining a calm, confident tone (he calls it the \u201Clate-night FM DJ voice\u201D) to project authority and reassurance, even under pressure.\n- **Practice Patience:** Hostage negotiations taught Voss that rushing can derail progress. Take your time to listen and build rapport.\n- **Prepare Thoroughly:** Know your goals, your limits (your \u201Cwalk-away\u201D point), and as much about the other party as possible before entering the negotiation.\n\nBy combining empathy, strategic questioning, and psychological insights, these FBI-inspired tactics can help you navigate tough conversations, build stronger relationships, and achieve your desired outcomes\u2014whether you\u2019re negotiating a business deal, a salary raise, or even a family disagreement. As Voss often says, \u201CNegotiation is not a battle; it\u2019s a discovery process.\u201D Focus on understanding the other side, and you\u2019ll often find the path to getting what you want.",
    "DeepSeek": "Of course. The negotiation tactics popularized by former FBI lead hostage negotiator Chris Voss are incredibly effective because they are rooted in human psychology, not brute force. They are designed to build trust, uncover the real objections, and make the other party feel safe and respected enough to say \u0022yes.\u0022\n\nThe core philosophy is: **Negotiation is not a battle; it\u0027s a collaborative process of discovery.** You\u0027re not trying to beat the other side; you\u0027re trying to persuade them that the best way for them to win is for you to win, too.\n\nHere are the key tactics from Chris Voss\u0027s system, as detailed in his book *Never Split the Difference*.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Foundation: The \u0022Late Night FM\u0022 Voice\nThis is the single most important tool to master first.\n*   **What it is:** A calm, slow, downward-inflecting tone. It sounds like a late-night radio DJ\u2014soothing, reassuring, and in control.\n*   **Why it works:** It de-escalates tension immediately. It signals that you are in control of your emotions and creates an atmosphere of safety. It makes the other person feel heard.\n*   **When to use it:** Almost constantly, especially when things get tense.\n\n### 2. Become a \u0022Mirror\u0022\nThis is a simple but powerful technique to build rapport and gather information.\n*   **What it is:** Repeating the last one to three critical words your counterpart just said, in the form of a question.\n*   **Example:**\n    *   *Them:* \u0022This proposal just doesn\u0027t work for us.\u0022\n    *   *You:* \u0022Doesn\u0027t work for you?\u0022\n    *   *Them:* \u0022Well, the pricing structure is too aggressive for this quarter.\u0022\n*   **Why it works:** It triggers a deep-seated human instinct to explain and elaborate. It makes the other person feel you are listening closely, and they will often reveal their true concerns without you having to ask.\n\n### 3. Practice Tactical Empathy\nThis is not about being nice; it\u0027s about being strategic.\n*   **What it is:** Understanding the other person\u0027s perspective and *verbally labeling* what you think they are feeling.\n*   **How to do it:** Use phrases that start with:\n    *   \u0022It seems like...\u0022\n    *   \u0022It sounds like...\u0022\n    *   \u0022It looks like...\u0022\n*   **Example:**\n    *   \u0022It sounds like you\u0027re worried about the implementation timeline.\u0022\n    *   \u0022It seems like you\u0027re frustrated with the current process.\u0022\n*   **Why it works:** It validates their emotions, which disarms negativity. When someone feels understood, their amygdala (the \u0022threat\u0022 center of the brain) calms down, allowing for rational conversation.\n\n### 4. Master the \u0022No\u0022\nMost people are trained to seek \u0022Yes.\u0022 Voss argues that getting to \u0022No\u0022 is more powerful.\n*   **What it is:** Reframing your questions to make it easy and safe for the other person to say \u0022no.\u0022\n*   **Example:**\n    *   Instead of: \u0022Do you agree with this proposal?\u0022 (Puts them on the spot for a \u0022yes\u0022 they may not mean).\n    *   Try: \u0022Is now a bad time to talk?\u0022 or \u0022Have you given up on this project?\u0022\n*   **Why it works:** \u0022No\u0022 makes people feel safe and in control. It allows them to define their boundaries. A strategic \u0022no\u0022 often opens the door to a real, committed \u0022yes\u0022 later. It\u0027s also a great way to confirm if the other party is still engaged.\n\n### 5. The Magic of \u0022That\u0027s Right\u0022\nYour goal is not to get a \u0022yes,\u0022 but to get the other person to say, **\u0022That\u0027s right.\u0022**\n*   **What it is:** This happens when you use a combination of mirroring and labeling to accurately summarize their situation and feelings. You show you truly understand their world.\n*   **Example:** After a few minutes of listening and labeling, you say: \u0022So, it seems like you\u0027re under a lot of pressure to deliver this quarter, and the current pricing would put your team in a bind, and you\u0027re worried we don\u0027t understand your constraints.\u0022\n*   **Why it works:** \u0022That\u0027s right\u0022 is a profound moment of breakthrough. It signals that trust has been established. The negotiation shifts from adversarial to collaborative.\n\n### 6. Bend Their Reality with the Ackerman Model\nA systematic method for bargaining, designed to avoid the trap of \u0022splitting the difference.\u0022\n*   **The 6 Steps:**\n    1.  **Set Your Target Price:** Know your goal.\n    2.  **Make Your First Offer at 65%:** Start low (but not insultingly so).\n    3.  **Plan Three Increases:** Plan to move to 85%, 95%, and 100%.\n    4.  **Use \u0022How\u0022 Questions:** After each rejected offer, ask \u0022How am I supposed to do that?\u0022 This puts the burden on them to solve your problem.\n    5.  **Use an Exact, Non-Round Number:** Your final offer should be a precise number (e.g., $47,500, not $48,000). It signals you\u0027ve reached your absolute limit.\n    6.  **Offer a Non-Monetary Concession:** At the very end, throw in something small that has high perceived value to them (e.g., \u0022And I\u0027ll throw in a dedicated training session for your team.\u0022).\n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together: A Sample Script\n\n**Scenario:** Negotiating a salary.\n\n*   **Manager:** \u0022I\u0027m afraid the best we can do is $80,000.\u0022\n*   **You:** (Using the Late Night FM Voice) \u0022I hear you. It seems like that\u0027s the number you have in the budget for this role.\u0022 **(Labeling)**\n*   **Manager:** \u0022Yes, exactly. We have to work within our constraints.\u0022\n*   **You:** \u0022Work within your constraints...\u0022 **(Mirroring)**\n*   **Manager:** \u0022Well, yes. We have benchmarks for this position, and we can\u0027t just blow them out of the water.\u0022\n*   **You:** \u0022It sounds like you\u0027re concerned about setting a precedent that would affect other teams.\u0022 **(Labeling)**\n*   **Manager:** \u0022That\u0027s a big part of it, yes. I have to be fair across the board.\u0022\n*   **You:** \u0022So, to make sure I understand\u2014you need to be fair across the board and stick to the benchmarks for this role, but you also see the unique value I\u0027m bringing to the table. Is that right?\u0022 **(Summary leading to \u0022That\u0027s Right\u0022)**\n*   **Manager:** \u0022That\u0027s right.\u0022\n*   **You:** \u0022Given that unique value, is there any flexibility at all if the base salary is firm? For example, on the bonus structure, signing bonus, or additional vacation time?\u0022 **(Using a \u0022No-Oriented\u0022 question: \u0022Is there any flexibility at all...\u0022)**\n\n### Final Golden Rule\n\n*   **Listen. Don\u0027t just wait for your turn to talk.** Your most powerful weapon is your ear. The other person will tell you everything you need to know to get to a deal\u2014if you\u0027re listening for it.\n\nThese tactics turn negotiation from a stressful confrontation into a psychological puzzle. Your goal is to understand the person across the table so well that a mutually beneficial deal becomes the most obvious and comfortable path forward.",
    "ChatGPT": "Certainly! FBI hostage negotiators are trained to use highly effective communication and psychological tactics to resolve high-stakes situations peacefully. Many of these tactics can be adapted for everyday negotiations to help you get what you want. Here are some key negotiation tactics inspired by FBI hostage negotiators:\n\n### 1. Build Rapport and Establish Trust\n- **Active Listening:** Listen carefully without interrupting. Show empathy and understanding.\n- **Use the Person\u2019s Name:** Personalize the conversation to create a connection.\n- **Mirror and Label Emotions:** Reflect their feelings (\u201CIt sounds like you\u2019re frustrated\u201D) to show you understand.\n\n### 2. Stay Calm and Patient\n- Keep your emotions in check. Negotiations often take time\u2014patience can be your greatest asset.\n- Respond calmly, even if the other party becomes emotional or aggressive.\n\n### 3. Use Open-Ended Questions\n- Encourage the other party to talk more about their needs and concerns.\n- Examples: \u201CCan you tell me more about what\u2019s important to you?\u201D or \u201CWhat would make this work for you?\u201D\n\n### 4. Avoid \u201CNo\u201D\u2014Use Positive Framing\n- Instead of saying \u201CNo,\u201D reframe responses to keep the conversation moving forward.\n- For example, instead of \u201CWe can\u2019t do that,\u201D say \u201CWhat we can do is\u2026\u201D\n\n### 5. Find Common Ground\n- Identify shared interests or goals to build cooperation.\n- Emphasize how an agreement benefits both sides.\n\n### 6. Use Tactical Empathy\n- Show deep understanding of the other party\u2019s feelings and perspective.\n- This does not mean agreeing, but demonstrating you grasp their situation.\n\n### 7. Create a \u201CWin-Win\u201D Solution\n- Aim for solutions where both parties feel satisfied.\n- This increases chances of long-term cooperation and reduces resistance.\n\n### 8. Use the \u201CAccusation Audit\u201D\n- Address any negative assumptions they might have upfront.\n- Example: \u201CYou might think I\u2019m trying to take advantage, but that\u2019s not my intention.\u201D\n\n### 9. Apply the \u201CFeel, Felt, Found\u201D Technique\n- \u201CI understand how you feel. Others have felt the same way, but they found that\u2026\u201D\n\n### 10. Use Silence and Patience Strategically\n- After making an offer or asking a question, remain silent and wait. People often fill silence with valuable information or concessions.\n\n### 11. Avoid Ultimatums and Threats\n- These escalate tension and reduce likelihood of agreement.\n\n### 12. Summarize and Confirm\n- Periodically recap what\u2019s been discussed to ensure understanding and build momentum.\n\n---\n\n### Example Chat Flow Using These Tactics:\n\n**You:** \u201CI understand you\u2019re concerned about the timeline. Can you tell me more about what deadlines you\u2019re working with?\u201D\n\n**Them:** \u201CWe really need it done by next week, or it\u2019s a big problem.\u201D\n\n**You:** \u201CIt sounds like the schedule is very important to you. Many clients I\u2019ve worked with felt the same pressure, but they found that extending just a little helped improve quality without significant impact. What if we explore options to meet your needs while ensuring high quality?\u201D\n\n**Them:** \u201CHmm, maybe that could work. What do you suggest?\u201D\n\n**You:** \u201CLet\u2019s look at some possibilities together. I want to make sure we find a solution that works well for both of us.\u201D\n\n---\n\nBy applying these FBI negotiation principles \u2014 emphasizing empathy, rapport, patience, and problem-solving \u2014 you can improve your ability to get what you want, even in difficult situations. If you want, I can provide specific scripts or role-play examples tailored to your negotiation scenario."
