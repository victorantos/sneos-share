    "ChatGPT": "The numbers you have listed for antidepressant users per 1,000 people appear broadly consistent with data from sources such as the OECD, WHO, and national health statistics, though exact figures can vary slightly due to differences in data collection years, definitions, and reporting methods.\n\nHere are a few points for reference:\n\n- Countries like Iceland, Portugal, Canada, Australia, and the USA generally report some of the highest rates of antidepressant use per 1,000 people, often exceeding 100 users per 1,000, which aligns with your numbers (e.g., Iceland at 161, Portugal 139, Canada 130).\n\n- European countries such as Sweden, UK, France, and Germany often have rates ranging from approximately 50 to over 100 per 1,000 population, which matches your data.\n\n- Lower rates in countries like India (9), Latvia (21), and Russia (23) also correspond with known lower consumption rates in those regions, often reflecting differences in healthcare access, stigma, and prescription practices.\n\n- South Korea (27) and Hungary (29) have relatively moderate levels reported in various studies, consistent with your figures.\n\nTo verify accuracy, it\u0027s recommended to consult the latest OECD Health Statistics antidepressant consumption data or WHO country profiles, as numbers can change over time.\n\nOverall, your list seems to be a reasonable representation of antidepressant user rates per 1,000 people as reported by major organizations.",
    "Claude": "I can\u0027t verify the exact accuracy of these specific numbers without access to the original sources, but I can share some general observations:\n\n**What seems plausible:**\n- The broad pattern aligns with known trends - Nordic countries, English-speaking countries, and some Western European nations typically have higher reported antidepressant usage rates\n- Iceland, Portugal, and Canada being at the top is consistent with OECD data I\u0027ve seen\n- Lower rates in countries like India and some Eastern European nations could reflect various factors (access, reporting, cultural attitudes toward mental health treatment)\n\n**What to consider:**\n- These statistics can vary significantly depending on:\n  - Data collection methods and year\n  - Whether they measure prescriptions vs. actual usage\n  - Healthcare system differences\n  - Cultural attitudes toward mental health treatment\n  - Access to healthcare and psychiatric services\n\n**Red flags to watch for:**\n- Social media \u0022stats\u0022 accounts sometimes mix data from different years or sources\n- The phrase \u0022according to OECD, WHO, and other local sources\u0022 is vague - legitimate statistics usually cite specific reports\n\n**My recommendation:** If you need these numbers for anything important, I\u0027d suggest checking the original OECD Health Statistics database or WHO reports directly, as they\u0027re the most reliable sources for this type of international health data.",
    "Gemini": "It\u0027s impossible to say definitively whether the numbers reported by \u0022X user stats_feed\u0022 are completely correct without knowing the exact source and methodology they used. However, we can analyze the list based on available data from reputable sources like the OECD, WHO, and other national health organizations, and point out areas that seem potentially inaccurate or require more context:\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   **OECD Focus:** The OECD does collect and publish data on antidepressant consumption. Their data is generally considered reliable, but focuses on member countries.  The inclusion of India, Russia, Costa Rica, and Brazil necessitates checking sources beyond just the OECD.\n*   **Variation in Data Collection:** Different countries use different methodologies for collecting data on antidepressant use. This can include prescription rates, sales figures, or survey data.  Direct comparisons should be made with caution.\n*   **Time Period:** Antidepressant usage can change over time.  The accuracy depends on the time period the data represents.  A specific year should be provided to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Per 1,000 vs. Per Capita:** The phrasing \u0022per 1,000 people\u0022 is often used interchangeably with \u0022per capita,\u0022 but it\u0027s important to be precise.\n\n**Potential Issues \u0026 Areas to Verify:**\n\n*   **India (9):** This number seems low compared to some estimates. While antidepressant use is lower in India than in many Western countries, 9 per 1,000 seems exceptionally low considering the prevalence of mental health issues and increasing awareness. Verify the source and methodology used to arrive at this figure.  Cultural factors, access to healthcare, and stigma play a significant role.\n*   **Latvia (21) \u0026 Lithuania (36):** These seem plausible but check against Eurostat data for prescription rates.\n*   **Russia (23):** This seems low compared to general mental health estimates, potential access and social stigma for mental health could play a factor.\n*   **Costa Rica (39) \u0026 Brazil (58):** These require careful sourcing.  Check for national health surveys or reports that include antidepressant usage data.\n*   **General Ranking:** The relative rankings seem generally plausible (Nordic countries and North America tend to be higher). However, the specific numbers should be verified against multiple sources.\n*   **High End (Iceland 161, Portugal 139, Canada 130, Australia 122, USA 110, UK 108, Sweden 105):** These higher numbers are in line with general trends and reported data from OECD and national health agencies, but the specific numbers should be validated.\n\n**How to Verify the Data:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** Find out the exact source \u0022X user stats_feed\u0022 used. Did they cite a specific OECD report, WHO publication, or national health survey?\n2.  **Check OECD Data:** Go to the OECD iLibrary and search for data on antidepressant consumption. Compare the numbers to the ones provided.  Look for data specifically on \u0022Pharmaceutical Consumption\u0022 or \u0022Mental Health.\u0022\n3.  **Consult WHO Data:** The WHO Mental Health Atlas might contain relevant information, though it might not provide the exact \u0022per 1,000\u0022 figures.\n4.  **Search for National Health Statistics:** For each country, search for the national health ministry or statistics agency website.  Look for reports or surveys on mental health and pharmaceutical usage. Examples:\n    *   **USA:** CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)\n    *   **UK:** NHS (National Health Service), Office for National Statistics (ONS)\n    *   **Canada:** Statistics Canada, Health Canada\n    *   **Australia:** Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)\n5.  **Look for Academic Studies:** Search Google Scholar for studies on antidepressant use in specific countries. These studies often provide more detailed data and analysis.\n6.  **Consider Methodology:** When comparing data, pay attention to the methodology used to collect the data. Are they based on prescriptions, sales, or surveys? What is the age range of the population included in the data?\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe list provided by \u0022X user stats_feed\u0022 gives a general overview, but **requires thorough verification before it can be considered definitively accurate.**  Focus on identifying the source, checking against reputable organizations like the OECD and WHO, and comparing with national health statistics. Be mindful of methodological differences and the time period the data represents. The figure for India seems particularly suspect and warrants extra scrutiny.\n"
