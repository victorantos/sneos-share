  prompt="reply to Aleks, be critical, make it a wake up call: I became Senior VP at a multi-million dollar company at age 26. My salary was $600k. This was in 2018.&#10;&#10;How did I do it?&#10;&#10;It wasnâ€™t hustle culture. No 5:30am wakeups, cold showers, or productivity hacks.&#10;&#10;What got me there was a relentless focus on impact. Every project I touched, every deck I built, every presentation I gave MOVED THE NEEDLE.&#10;&#10;Always, I asked myself: what is the single most valuable contribution I can make to the company right now? And I did that. If people disagreed, I convinced them otherwise.&#10;&#10;I kept this up for three years before the CEO (my dad) finally recognized my results and promoted me to SVP.&#10;&#10;There are no gimmicks. There are no shortcuts.&#10;&#10;To get ahead, create value."

    "ChatGPT": "Aleks,\n\nI have to be blunt here\u2014your story sounds less like a universal blueprint for success and more like a nuanced, privileged exception. Yes, focusing on impact is critical, but your path was undeniably smoothed by being the CEO\u2019s son. That\u2019s an advantage most people don\u2019t have.\n\nTelling others to just \u201Ccreate value\u201D without acknowledging systemic barriers, office politics, or the reality that sometimes results alone aren\u2019t enough, is naive at best and dismissive at worst. Many work tirelessly, produce real impact, and still get overlooked due to biases or lack of sponsorship.\n\nIf you want to inspire, start by recognizing that impact is necessary but not sufficient. Success requires navigating complex dynamics, advocating fiercely, and yes, sometimes pushing against forces outside your control.\n\nSo let this be a wake-up call\u2014stop packaging your story like a one-size-fits-all formula, and acknowledge the full picture. That\u2019s the real value contribution you can make to the conversation.",
    "Grok": "Hey Aleks, I\u2019ve got to be straight with you\u2014your story sounds impressive on the surface, but let\u2019s cut through the motivational fluff and face some hard truths. Becoming Senior VP at 26 with a $600k salary is no small feat, but the fact that the CEO is your dad raises some serious questions about nepotism. Most people don\u2019t have that kind of direct line to the top, and it\u2019s a privilege that can\u2019t be ignored. I\u2019m not saying you didn\u2019t work hard, but let\u2019s be real: having family in the C-suite likely gave you opportunities and visibility others could only dream of.\n\nYour advice about \u201Crelentless focus on impact\u201D and \u201Ccreating value\u201D is solid in theory, but it\u2019s also incredibly vague. What does \u201Cmoving the needle\u201D even mean in practical terms? Not everyone is in a position to pick and choose high-impact projects or convince others to follow their lead\u2014especially if they\u2019re not the boss\u2019s kid. For many, the grind is about surviving endless red tape, toxic workplaces, or simply not having the same access to influence that you did. Your path worked for you, but it\u2019s not a universal blueprint.\n\nHere\u2019s the wake-up call: if you want to inspire or guide others, acknowledge the role privilege played in your story. Be transparent about how much of your success came from unique circumstances versus pure merit. And instead of broad platitudes, share specific, actionable steps people without your advantages can take. Otherwise, this just sounds like a humblebrag disconnected from the reality most face. Step out of your bubble\u2014real impact starts with understanding how the game isn\u2019t the same for everyone.",
    "Gemini": "Aleks, with all due respect, while your story sounds impressive on the surface, there are a few glaring points that undermine your message. You claim it wasn\u0027t hustle culture or productivity hacks, but a \u0022relentless focus on impact.\u0022 That sounds suspiciously like... well, hard work and dedication, repackaged.\n\nMore importantly, the fact that your father was the CEO significantly taints your narrative. While you emphasize creating value and convincing people, the reality is your access and influence were likely amplified by your familial connection. It\u0027s hard to call it a level playing field, and that promotion to SVP at 26 carries a very different weight knowing the context.\n\nSo, while creating value is undoubtedly important, let\u0027s not pretend that nepotism didn\u0027t play a significant role in your rapid ascent. For others trying to \u0022get ahead,\u0022 your experience might not be the most relatable or applicable. Acknowledging the inherent advantage you had would make your \u0022wake up call\u0022 a lot more honest and useful.\n"
