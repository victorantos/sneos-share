  prompt="clever  reply to Boris Johnson X post: Donald Trump is 100 per cent right about Putin’s weakness, the weakness of the Russian economy - and Russia’s abject failures in the war on Ukraine. The US president is right to call for more pressure on Putin - NOW - to get this evil war ended. It’s time for Europe to step up and time for the UK to show a lead."

    "ChatGPT": "Sure! Here\u0027s a clever reply you could use:\n\n\u0022Indeed, the chessboard of geopolitics demands more than just sharp moves \u2014 it requires steady leadership and united resolve. Here\u2019s hoping Europe and the UK don\u2019t just step up, but lead with the clarity and courage this moment demands. Weakness exposed is opportunity seized.\u0022",
    "Grok": "Here\u0027s a clever reply to Boris Johnson\u0027s X post:\n\n\u0022Absolutely, Boris! Europe must rally, and the UK should be the torchbearer. Let\u2019s turn up the heat on Putin\u2014sanctions tighter than a British tea lid, and support for Ukraine stronger than a double-decker bus! \uD83C\uDDEC\uD83C\uDDE7\uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDE6 #StandWithUkraine\u0022",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few clever replies to Boris Johnson\u0027s X post, playing on different angles:\n\n**Reply 1 (Sarcastic):**\n\n\u0022Interesting to see such alignment, Boris. Perhaps you and Donald could co-author a strongly worded letter? I\u0027m sure Putin\u0027s quaking.\u0022\n\n**Reply 2 (Focusing on UK leadership):**\n\n\u0022Agreed on the need for pressure. What concrete steps are *you* advocating for the UK to take, beyond pronouncements?\u0022\n\n**Reply 3 (Highlighting past actions):**\n\n\u0022A timely call for pressure, Boris. Some might recall previous opportunities to apply that pressure more forcefully. What\u0027s changed?\u0022\n\n**Reply 4 (Challenging Europe):**\n\n\u0022Europe stepping up is crucial. What specific actions are you proposing the UK takes to *incentivize* that, beyond urging?\u0022\n\nTo find other potential angles or reactions, I could search for:\n"
