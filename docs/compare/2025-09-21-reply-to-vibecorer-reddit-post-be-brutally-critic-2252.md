    "Gemini": "Alright, buckle up, Vibecorer, because reality is about to hit you harder than your conversion rate probably did.\n\n\u0022Just a week ago, I finished my app...\u0022 Okay, and? You\u0027re acting like you just discovered fire. Finishing the app is the *bare minimum*. It\u0027s the starting line, not the finish line. You managed to do what you set out to do \u2013 congratulations, you\u0027re functional.\n\n\u0022Sent an email to all early sign ups...\u0022 Oh, wow, groundbreaking marketing strategy there. You notified the people *who already expressed interest* that the thing they were interested in is now available. You deserve a medal. Seriously though, what was your plan here, to *not* tell them?\n\n\u0022Little did I know actually lots of them were waiting for that tool to finish \u0026 actually converted!\u0022 This is where the cringe peaks. You sound genuinely surprised that people who signed up to use your tool *actually wanted to use it*. Did you think they were just signing up for your riveting newsletter? This isn\u0027t some stroke of genius on your part; it\u0027s the result of people having a need and you (hopefully) fulfilling it. Don\u0027t mistake basic functionality for market mastery.\n\nThe real question is: what happens *now*? Early adopters are great, but are you prepared to scale? What\u0027s your marketing strategy beyond emailing the initial list? What\u0027s your plan for customer retention? Are you *actually* solving a problem, or are you just a shiny new toy that people will abandon in a month?\n\nStop patting yourself on the back for clearing the lowest possible bar and start thinking strategically. This isn\u0027t the time for humblebrags on Reddit; it\u0027s time to put in the real work.\n",
    "Grok": "Hey vibecorer, I\u2019ve got to be brutally honest here\u2014your post comes off as a vague humblebrag with zero substance. Congrats on finishing your app, but what exactly are we supposed to take away from this? You\u2019ve provided no details about what the app does, why it matters, or what kind of problem it solves. Saying \u201Clots of them converted\u201D is meaningless without context\u2014lots of what, 5 people? 50? 500? And converted to what, a free trial or actual paying customers? \n\nIf you\u2019re posting to share success, at least give us something tangible to engage with. What challenges did you face building it? What made those early sign-ups so eager to jump on board? Right now, this just reads like a pat on your own back without offering any value or insight to the community. Step it up\u2014give us the real story, or don\u2019t bother posting at all.",
    "ChatGPT": "Here\u2019s a brutally critical reply you can use:\n\n\u0022Honestly, it sounds like you completely underestimated your audience and wasted a ton of time. Finishing your app just a week ago after people were already waiting? That\u0027s amateurish project management at best. Getting lucky that some actually converted doesn\u0027t change the fact that you clearly failed to gauge demand or communicate effectively beforehand. If you can\u2019t even manage a simple rollout and engagement strategy, what hope does your app have for long-term success?\u0022"
