  prompt="redditor posts about users who want to save on hotels, make brutally critical reply: UPDATE: reached 250k users who want to save on hotels with travel extension&#10;Hey everyone, I wanted to update you on how we are helping travelers save on their stays with Directo Extension.&#10;&#10;My goal is simple: help you find better deals on hotels or vacation rentals by giving you the direct site to the same place you are seeing on the travel platforms. So saving you the time to google or reverse-image search.&#10;&#10;Since finding our groove back in September we have grown from 5000 to over 2500k users in less than 2 years.&#10;&#10;Because we want to make it even better we are now testing the following features:&#10;&#10;Price comparison:&#10;When we have it, we show you the price on the booking platform vs booking&#10;&#10;2. Coupon found&#10;&#10;Similar to Honey, we track and seach for coupons so you can get a discount booking directly.&#10;&#10;3. User validated deals&#10;&#10;We ask users who visit the direct site to tell us if they have found a better deal or not by booking directly. When a property gets lots of votes, we add this information so travelers can see where others have found a better deal.&#10;&#10;Out of all of these, which do you consider makes it a better experience for the user? Or what are we missing?"

    "Gemini": "To improve the user experience of the Directo Extension, consider the following:\n\nOf the features being tested, price comparison and user-validated deals likely offer the most value to users. Price comparison provides immediate, concrete savings information, while user-validated deals offer social proof and build trust in the platform. The coupon feature is useful, but its effectiveness depends on the availability of working coupons.\n\nHere\u0027s what might be missing:\n\n*   **More transparency:** Clearly display how the extension finds direct sites and verifies deals.\n*   **Personalization:** Tailor recommendations and deals based on user travel preferences and history.\n*   **Mobile app:** Offer a mobile app for on-the-go deal hunting.\n*   **Customer support:** Provide a way for users to report issues or ask for help.\n*   **Integration with loyalty programs:** Allow users to link their hotel loyalty accounts and see if booking directly earns them points or benefits.\n\n",
    "Grok": "Hey, congrats on the growth to 250k users (though I think you meant 250k, not 2500k, since that\u2019s a pretty insane jump from 5k in just 2 years). I\u2019m gonna be brutally honest here because if you\u2019re serious about helping travelers save on hotels with Directo Extension, you need to hear the hard truth.\n\nYour concept of linking directly to hotel or rental sites to bypass travel platform fees is solid in theory, but the execution and features you\u2019re testing sound like they\u2019re half-baked at best. Let\u2019s break this down with a critical eye:\n\n1. **Price Comparison**: This is the bare minimum you should be offering. If you\u2019re not consistently showing a clear, real-time price difference between booking platforms and direct sites, then what\u2019s the point of your extension? Travelers aren\u2019t dumb\u2014they can Google prices themselves if your tool isn\u2019t reliable or comprehensive. The fact that you say \u201Cwhen we have it\u201D makes me think this isn\u2019t even fully rolled out or dependable. If you can\u2019t guarantee accurate comparisons across most properties, this feature is just a gimmick.\n\n2. **Coupon Found**: Mimicking Honey is a cute idea, but let\u2019s be real\u2014Honey and similar extensions already dominate this space. Unless your coupon database is somehow magically better or exclusive to direct hotel bookings, you\u2019re just playing catch-up. Plus, coupons for direct bookings are often sparse or outdated since hotels push their own loyalty programs instead. If you\u2019re not finding unique, verified discounts, this feature feels like fluff.\n\n3. **User Validated Deals**: This has potential, but it\u2019s also a massive red flag. Relying on user feedback for \u201Cbetter deals\u201D opens the door to bias, fake reviews, or just plain bad data. How are you vetting these votes? What\u2019s stopping a hotel from gaming the system with bots or incentivized reviews? Without strict moderation or transparency on how \u201Clots of votes\u201D translates to a trustworthy recommendation, this could easily mislead users into thinking they\u2019re getting a deal when they\u2019re not. Plus, if a property doesn\u2019t have many votes yet, it\u2019s useless info for the user.\n\n**Which feature makes the user experience better?** Honestly, Price Comparison is the only one that feels essential\u2014if it works flawlessly. The others are either redundant or risky without serious refinement. But even then, I\u2019m skeptical about how much value you\u2019re actually adding over just manually checking a hotel\u2019s site.\n\n**What are you missing?** Here\u2019s the brutal part: your extension sounds like a middleman trying to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t fully exist. Most savvy travelers already know booking direct *can* save money (as seen in posts on platforms like X where users and travel experts repeatedly stress this). Your growth numbers are impressive, but are these 250k users actually saving significant cash, or are they just installing because it\u2019s free and shiny? Show us hard stats\u2014average savings per booking, success rate of direct deals, something concrete. Right now, it feels like hype over substance.\n\nYou\u2019re also missing:\n- **Loyalty Program Integration**: Direct bookings often come with perks like points or free upgrades that platforms can\u2019t match. Why not highlight or integrate with hotel loyalty programs to show users the full value of booking direct?\n- **Fee Transparency**: Platforms like Booking.com often hide fees until checkout. If you\u2019re not breaking down the *true* cost (taxes, resort fees, etc.) of platform vs. direct, your price comparison is incomplete.\n- **Mobile Support**: If this is just a Chrome extension (as web info suggests), you\u2019re ignoring a huge chunk of travelers who book on apps or mobile browsers. That\u2019s a massive oversight in 2025.\n- **Trust Signals**: With no mention of data privacy or how you\u2019re not just another data-harvesting tool, users like me are wary. What\u2019s your business model? Are you selling our search data to hotels or platforms?\n\nI\u2019m not saying Directo Extension is useless\u2014helping people save on fees is a noble goal. But right now, it sounds like a solution looking for a problem. If you want to stand out, focus on undeniable value (rock-solid price comparisons, real savings stats) and fix the glaring gaps. Otherwise, you\u2019re just another browser plugin cluttering up my toolbar. What\u2019s your response to this? How are you planning to address reliability and trust? Lay it out.",
    "ChatGPT": "Wow, 250,000 users and this is what you\u2019re bragging about? A glorified price comparison tool that basically makes people do the same legwork they could do themselves for free? Let me get this straight: you started with 5,000 users and somehow think that throwing in \u201Ccoupon tracking\u201D and asking users to validate deals is some revolutionary feature? Newsflash: savvy travelers have been doing all this for years with better services and less hand-holding. The entire concept reeks of redundancy \u2014 rehashing information travelers can Google in minutes and slapping a slightly fancier interface on it. Oh, and calling it a \u201CDirecto Extension\u201D doesn\u2019t make it magical or unique. People want genuine savings and efficiency, not another half-baked tool that just adds noise. Maybe try innovating beyond \u201CHey look, we found some coupons\u201D and actually build something that delivers value without acting like a glorified brochure. Otherwise, this feels like a thinly veiled grab for clicks from naive users who don\u2019t know better."
