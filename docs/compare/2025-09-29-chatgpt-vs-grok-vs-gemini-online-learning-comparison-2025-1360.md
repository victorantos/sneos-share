    "DeepSeek": "Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of what makes AI so transformative for education. The \u0022best\u0022 AI tutor isn\u0027t a single tool, but rather the right tool matched to a specific learning style.\n\nHere is a detailed comparison of the best AI tutors, broken down by learning style, with a focus on personalized education.\n\n### The Core Idea: From Tool to Tutor\nTraditional learning tools are one-size-fits-all. AI tutors can dynamically adapt to *how you learn*. The key is to use prompts that guide the AI into the role of your ideal tutor.\n\n---\n\n### AI Tutors for Different Learning Styles\n\n#### 1.
