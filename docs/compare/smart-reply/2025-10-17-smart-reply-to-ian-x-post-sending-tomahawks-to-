    "ChatGPT": "A smart reply could be:\n\n\u0022Escalation risks are real, but standing by in the face of aggression could also have dire consequences. The key is careful diplomacy combined with measured support to avoid triggering a wider conflict while defending sovereignty.\u0022",
    "Grok": "While escalation risks are real\u2014Russia\u0027s SVR chief Naryshkin called Tomahawks a \u0022hostile step\u0022 today\u2014Putin\u0027s already tested Oreshnik in Ukraine without sparking WWIII. Supplying them might deter more than provoke, but diplomacy beats doomsday tweets. Let\u0027s push for talks, not panic. #UkraineRussia",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few smart reply options to the X post:\n\n*   \u0022Escalation is a serious concern, and all options should be considered carefully.\u0022\n*   \u0022That\u0027s a strong claim. What evidence suggests a direct Russian response like that?\u0022\n*   \u0022Do you think there are ways to support Ukraine without provoking a wider conflict?\u0022\n"
