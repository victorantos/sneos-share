    "ChatGPT": "Many Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates have long histories of peaceful coexistence with diverse faith communities. It\u0027s important to recognize that peaceful coexistence depends more on cultural, social, and political factors than on religion alone.",
    "Grok": "Indonesia: World\u0027s largest Muslim population (over 200M), yet Hindus thrive in Bali, Christians in many regions, and it\u0027s a democracy with \u0022Unity in Diversity\u0022 as its motto. No major religious strife. Check it out! \uD83C\uDDEE\uD83C\uDDE9\u270C\uFE0F",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few options for a smart reply to the X post from an Afghan Zoroastrian asking \u0022Name a single country where Muslims coexist peacefully with other faiths?\u0022:\n\n*   \u0022There are many examples of peaceful coexistence. Off the top of my head, I can name Indonesia, Malaysia, and Egypt, to name a few.\u0022\n*   \u0022While challenges exist, many countries strive for peaceful coexistence between Muslims and other faiths. Examples include India, Lebanon, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u0022\n*   \u0022It\u0027s a complex issue, but places like Senegal and Tanzania have strong traditions of interfaith harmony.\u0022\n*   \u0022Have you considered looking at the history of Andalusia? It\u0027s not a country, but it is an example of Muslims, Christians, and Jews living together peacefully.\u0022\n\nTo provide even more relevant and specific examples, I can search for countries recognized for successful interfaith coexistence involving Muslim communities. Would you like me to do that?\n"
