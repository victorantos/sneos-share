    "ChatGPT": "Absolutely, Elon! Even in the noise, ideas spark and evolve \u2014 the true power of a global town square is turning chatter into change. Here\u0027s to keeping the conversation going! #DialogueDrivesProgress",
    "Claude": "Here are a few clever reply options:\n\n**Option 1 (Playful):**\n\u0022Just like any good town square, sometimes you need a few digital street sweepers to keep things tidy \uD83E\uDDF9\u0022\n\n**Option 2 (Witty):**\n\u0022True, though this town square has surprisingly good Wi-Fi and questionably effective moderators\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (Thoughtful with humor):**\n\u0022A town square where everyone gets a megaphone and nobody has to leave when it rains. The ancient Greeks would be confused but impressed.\u0022\n\n**Option 4 (Self-aware):**\n\u0022The only town square where you can get into a philosophical debate, see a cat video, and accidentally start a conspiracy theory all in the same scroll\u0022\n\nEach plays off the town square metaphor while adding a bit of wit without being too confrontational or overly flattering.",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few clever replies to the Elon Musk X post you provided:\n\n*   \u0022A global town square with a pay-to-speak megaphone.\u0022\n*   \u0022More like a global town square where the loudest voice gets amplified, regardless of truth.\u0022\n*   \u0022A town square where everyone\u0027s shouting, but few are listening.\u0022\n*   \u0022Global town square? More like a global echo chamber.\u0022\n*   \u0022If this is a town square, it needs better moderation and a lost-and-found for common sense.\u0022\n*   \u0022A global town square still under construction, with occasional falling debris.\u0022\n"
