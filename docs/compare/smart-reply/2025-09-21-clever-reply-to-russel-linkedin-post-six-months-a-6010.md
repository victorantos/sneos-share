  prompt="clever reply to Russel Linkedin post: Six months ago, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei said:&#10;&#10;“Within 6 months, AI will be writing 90% of code.”&#10;&#10;Well… here we are. And those numbers don’t add up. &#10;&#10;Not even close.&#10;&#10;So why would a CEO make such a bold (and wrong) prediction?&#10;&#10;I think there are two main reasons:&#10;&#10;1. Incentives.&#10;&#10;CEOs like Amodei, Sam Altman, and others don’t speak to developers. They speak to markets. Their job is to make the stock go up... plain and simple. &#10;&#10;That’s why every keynote sounds like a breakthrough happened yesterday and AGI is days away. It drives hype, gets more users, and keeps investors bullish. &#10;&#10;But it’s not the reality programmers live in.&#10;&#10;2. The unsolved problem of context.&#10;&#10;Programmers write code with a vision in their heads: the look, the feel, the function. When we code ourselves, we turn that mental model into JavaScript, Python, C++, whatever. &#10;&#10;But when we vibe code with AI, we skip the vision. &#10;&#10;We say things like, “build a login modal with auth.” The AI doesn’t know what’s in our head, so it guesses. And every guess compounds the mess. &#10;&#10;That’s why so much AI-generated code sucks when you actually try to ship it.&#10;&#10;And that’s why predictions like “90% of code written by AI” are laughable.&#10;&#10;Developers still trust what they understand and AI doesn’t understand us. &#10;&#10;Not yet.&#10;&#10;Maybe one day when Elon Musk connects Neuralink to Cursor, we’ll be able to truly “vibe code” our thoughts directly into production-ready apps. &#10;&#10;Until then, we’re building Precursor to help you get your vision onto paper before you start coding... limiting hallucinations, reducing bugs, and making vibe coding just a little closer to the dream these CEOs are painting.&#10;&#10;Do you think we’re actually on the path to 90% of code being written by AI… or is that vision still 90% out of reach?"

    "Gemini": "Here are a few possible replies to the LinkedIn post, playing on different angles:\n\n**Reply 1 (Sarcastic/Humorous):**\n\n\u003E \u002290% of code in 6 months,\u0022 huh? I guess my debugging skills are becoming a vintage art form faster than I thought! Seriously though, I think you\u0027re spot on about the incentives. It\u0027s easy to get caught up in the hype, but the reality for those of us actually *building* things is a bit more nuanced. I\u0027m with you \u2013 the \u0022vibe coding\u0022 dream is still a ways off. Precursor sounds like a smart step in the right direction!\n\n**Reply 2 (Analytical/Agreeing):**\n\n\u003E Excellent points. The pressure to create market excitement definitely influences these predictions. The context problem is huge \u2013 AI can generate *code*, but it can\u0027t (yet) understand the *why* behind it. I think we\u0027ll see AI become a powerful *assistive* tool, but 90% autonomous code generation is a long way off. Tools like Precursor that help bridge that gap by clarifying the vision upfront are essential.\n\n**Reply 3 (Slightly Critical/Provocative):**\n\n\u003E While I agree that 90% is an exaggeration, I wonder if we\u0027re underestimating the speed of progress. The incentives *are* misaligned, and the context problem is real... but AI is also improving rapidly. Maybe not 90% in 6 months, but perhaps a significant shift is closer than we think. What are your thoughts on how developers can best prepare for a world where AI *does* play a much larger role in code generation, even if it\u0027s not quite 90%?\n\n**Reply 4 (Focus on Precursor):**\n\n\u003E The \u0022vibe coding\u0022 dream! Love it. It highlights the fundamental gap between AI\u0027s output and the human vision behind the project. It\u0027s great to see you\u0027re tackling this head-on with Precursor. A focus on clarifying the vision *before* diving into code seems like the most practical way to leverage AI\u0027s potential without drowning in a sea of buggy, context-free suggestions. Still a long way to go before AI writes 90% of the code.\n\nTo choose the best reply, consider:\n\n*   **Your personal brand:** Do you want to be seen as humorous, analytical, critical, or promotional?\n*   **Your goals:** Are you trying to spark debate, promote your own company/product, or simply agree with the original poster?\n*   **Your relationship with the poster:** Are you friends, colleagues, or strangers?\n\nI hope these options give you a good starting point!\n",
    "Grok": "Hey Russel, love the sharp take on the AI hype machine! I\u2019m with you\u2014Dario Amodei\u2019s \u201C90% of code by AI in 6 months\u201D prediction feels like a sci-fi trailer rather than a developer\u2019s reality. The incentive angle is spot on; CEOs are pitching to investors, not debugging with us in the trenches. And the context problem? Nailed it. AI can churn out code, but without \u201Cseeing\u201D our vision, it\u2019s often just a fancy guess that needs heavy refactoring.\n\nThat said, I think we\u2019re on a path toward *more* AI-written code, but 90% feels like a distant dream\u2014maybe 90% wishful thinking for now. Tools like Precursor sound promising to bridge that gap between vision and execution. I\u2019m curious, though: even if AI could write 90% of the code, would we trust it without human oversight? I\u2019m betting most devs still want to keep their hands on the wheel. What\u2019s your take on striking that balance?",
    "ChatGPT": "Great insights, Russel! It\u2019s a classic case of the hype cycle meeting hard reality. CEOs aiming for the stars to keep investors excited, while us devs are still wrestling with AI\u2019s \u201Cinterpretation errors.\u201D Until AI truly understands the vision behind the code\u2014not just the syntax\u2014we\u2019ll be writing the \u201C90%\u201D ourselves, with AI playing the trusty sidekick. Looking forward to the day when Neuralink meets Cursor and \u201Cvibe coding\u201D goes from sci-fi to standard practice! Until then, tools like Precursor are the pragmatic bridge between our imagination and the messy code it spawns. Cheers to keeping it real while dreaming big!"
