  prompt="smart reply to John Costa story on Linkedin: Yesterday, I spent 2 hours building a feature we didn't need.&#10;&#10;&#10;This happens more often than you think, as an engineer, you play around with solutions, evaluate if they are useful, and if they are not you throw them away (maybe commit them first just in case!).&#10;&#10;But why spend this much time? Simple. I didn't make the requirements of the problem clear before I started working.&#10;&#10;The feature was simple enough, but after working on implementing it, I took a break from coding and went over some documentation and user stories. Turns out we don't need this.&#10;&#10;It is important to have a good plan in mind before you start working. Just to make sure you are working to something you actually need. A startup cannot afford to waste time building features no one uses, it is extra complexity to manage, for no to no business value.&#10;&#10;Focus on what your users want, and build the smallest solution that could solve that problem. Expand it when needed. Stay lean.&#10;&#10;Share your stories! What is your &quot;Oh, we don't need this&quot; moment?"

    "ChatGPT": "Great story, John! It\u2019s a perfect reminder that sometimes the best code is the code you don\u2019t write. Clarifying requirements upfront not only saves time but also keeps the product lean and focused. I\u2019ve had my share of \u201Cbuild, then realize\u201D moments\u2014each one a valuable lesson in the art of balancing speed with precision. Thanks for sharing and encouraging us to keep the user\u2019s needs front and center!",
    "Claude": "Here are a few smart reply options:\n\n**Option 1 (Relatable \u002B Actionable):**\n\u0022Been there! My \u0027aha\u0027 moment was spending a whole day building an elaborate caching system... only to realize our traffic was nowhere near needing it \uD83D\uDE05 Now I have a simple rule: write the problem statement in one sentence before touching code. If I can\u0027t explain WHY we need it clearly, it\u0027s probably premature optimization.\u0022\n\n**Option 2 (Strategic \u002B Experience-based):**\n\u0022This resonates! I once built a complex user permission system thinking \u0027we\u0027ll need this eventually\u0027 - spoiler: we didn\u0027t. The real cost isn\u0027t just the 2 hours building it, but the mental overhead of maintaining dead code. Now I\u0027m obsessed with the question: \u0027What\u0027s the simplest thing that could possibly work?\u0027 Great reminder, John!\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (Community-focused):**\n\u0022Classic engineering trap! My favorite \u0027we don\u0027t need this\u0027 story: spent hours optimizing a database query that ran once per day \uD83E\uDD26\u200D\u2642\uFE0F The silver lining? These \u0027failed\u0027 experiments often teach us more about the problem space than successful features. Sometimes the most valuable code is the code you don\u0027t write.\u0022\n\nEach reply acknowledges his experience, shares a relatable story, and adds value to the conversation while keeping it concise and engaging.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, I will generate a few smart reply options for the LinkedIn post.\n\n"
