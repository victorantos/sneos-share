  prompt="clever reply to John Carmack X post: Sometimes I see papers with hyperparameter sweeps over 0.001, 0.003, 0.006, 0.01, etc. Many hyperparameters are better expressed in negative integral log2. Small values like learning rates directly, and values close to 1 like EMA factors and TD lambda / gamma with 1-2**val.&#10;&#10;It is interesting how many parameters are relatively insensitive to doubling or halving, and need bigger changes to reliably move the results."

    "ChatGPT": "\u0022Agreed! It\u2019s like hyperparameters prefer to live on a logarithmic scale \u2014 doubling or halving feels like a casual stroll, but to really shake things up, you need to take a giant leap. Makes tuning both an art and a science!\u0022",
    "Grok": "Hey John, love the insight on hyperparameter sweeps! Framing them in negative integral log2 is a brilliant way to cut through the noise\u2014makes those tiny learning rates and near-1 values like EMA factors or gamma much more intuitive. And yeah, it\u2019s wild how often doubling or halving barely nudges the needle. Guess some parameters just shrug off our tweaks like they\u2019ve got a mind of their own! Curious, do you think this insensitivity hints at deeper architectural robustness or just overparameterization?",
    "Gemini": "Okay, I understand. You\u0027re indicating that you want me to generate a clever reply to John Carmack\u0027s X post regarding hyperparameter sweeps. The core idea is that many hyperparameters are more effectively expressed and tuned using negative integral log2 values, and that parameters often exhibit insensitivity to doubling or halving.\n\nHere are a few options for a clever reply, playing on different aspects of his observation:\n\n**Option 1 (Practical/Slightly Sarcastic):**\n\n\u0022Agreed. And sometimes I see papers sweeping over 0.001, 0.003, 0.006, 0.01... because that\u0027s what the last paper did, and nobody wants to be *wrong*.\u0022 (Implies a lack of deeper understanding and cargo-cult hyperparameter tuning).\n\n**Option 2 (Mathematical/Insightful):**\n\n\u0022The log2 domain makes intuitive sense when you consider the underlying iterative processes. Each doubling/halving represents a significant shift in the parameter\u0027s influence over time. Linear sweeps often miss these inflection points.\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (Humorous/Relatable):**\n\n\u0022My hyperparameter sweeps are usually just me frantically adjusting values until the loss function stops yelling at me. Maybe I SHOULD start thinking in negative integral log2...\u0022\n\n**Option 4 (Challenging/Thought-Provoking):**\n\n\u0022Interesting point, John. Does this suggest our optimization algorithms are inherently biased towards scales that align with powers of 2? Or is it simply a reflection of the way we *interpret* the parameter space?\u0022\n\n**Option 5 (Simple Agreement/Expansion):**\n\n\u0022Good observation! It highlights the importance of understanding the *effective range* of a hyperparameter. Sweeping linearly across an irrelevant range is just wasted compute.\u0022\n\nTo give you a *really* clever reply, I\u0027d need more context on the specific area John Carmack is discussing (e.g., specific type of model, optimization algorithm, etc.). But these should give you a good starting point.\n"
