    "ChatGPT": "Here\u2019s a clever reply you could use:\n\n\u201CRob, at this rate, the UK\u2019s already running a masterclass in \u2018wealth taxation 101\u2019 \u2014 the curriculum just keeps expanding! Maybe instead of millionaires, what will really be leaving is the notion that the UK doesn\u2019t have progressive taxation. Exit tax or wealth tax, it seems the \u2018tax tour\u2019 has long been in full swing.\u201D",
    "Claude": "Here are a few clever reply options:\n\n**Option 1 (Playfully Pedantic):**\n\u0022Rob, calling income tax a \u0027wealth tax\u0027 is like calling a Ferrari a bicycle because they both have wheels. Income \u2260 wealth. I can earn \u00A3150k and still be house-poor in London, while someone with \u00A310m in assets pays zero if they don\u0027t work. But I appreciate the creative accounting! \uD83D\uDE09\u0022\n\n**Option 2 (Economic Reality Check):**\n\u0022Fascinating thread! Though worth noting that every major economy has progressive taxation - it\u0027s not uniquely punitive, it\u0027s just math. The real question isn\u0027t whether millionaires will leave, but whether the ones who stay will create more value than the tax revenue lost from those who go. Singapore vs Switzerland will be watching with interest!\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (Cheeky but Constructive):**\n\u0022Plot twist: What if instead of an exit tax, we had an \u0027entry incentive\u0027 for the productive millionaires who\u0027d replace the departing ones? France tried the wealth tax experiment and reversed it - sometimes the best policy is learning from others\u0027 expensive mistakes.\u0022\n\n**Option 4 (Direct Challenge):**\n\u0022Rob, genuine question: If these are already \u0027wealth taxes,\u0027 and you\u0027re still here, what\u0027s the actual tipping point? Seems like the threat might be more powerful than the reality. Also, inflation as a wealth tax? That hits the asset-poor hardest - quite the opposite effect!\u0022\n\nPick your tone based on your relationship with Rob and your audience!",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here are a few clever replies to Rob Moore\u0027s LinkedIn post, playing on different aspects of his argument:\n\n**Reply 1 (Sarcastic):**\n\n\u0022Rob, with all due respect, your definition of \u0027wealth tax\u0027 seems to include pretty much every form of taxation. If we frame it that way, we\u0027ve *always* had wealth taxes! Perhaps the real question is about the *level* and *fairness* of taxation, rather than pretending existing taxes are somehow new and shocking wealth grabs. And if a few more millionaires leaving makes room for innovation and growth from others, is that really such a bad thing?\u0022\n\n**Reply 2 (Addressing the \u0022Leaving\u0022 Threat):**\n\n\u0022It\u0027s interesting how the threat of leaving is always the first response. Is a country only valuable as long as it\u0027s maximally profitable for the wealthiest? Perhaps a more productive conversation would be about how a fair tax system can benefit everyone in the UK, not just those at the very top. Also, where would you go that has *no* taxes that you could define as \u0027wealth taxes\u0027?\u0022\n\n**Reply 3 (Focusing on Services):**\n\n\u0022You\u0027re right that we get the same services regardless of property value with council tax, but those services (roads, schools, healthcare) are essential for *everyone*, including businesses and wealthy individuals. A functioning society requires investment. The question isn\u0027t whether taxes exist, but whether they are levied fairly and used effectively to create a thriving environment for all.\u0022\n\n**Reply 4 (Playing on the \u0022Need I go on?\u0022):**\n\n\u0022Need you go on? Actually, yes, please do! It would be helpful to understand specifically which Labour proposals you\u0027re referring to and how they differ *in practice* from the current tax regime. Generalizing everything as a \u0027wealth tax\u0027 isn\u0027t particularly insightful.\u0022\n\n**Reply 5 (More Direct/Confrontational):**\n\n\u0022Rob, many people are struggling significantly *without* being millionaires. While your concerns are valid from your perspective, perhaps consider the impact of austerity and underfunded public services on the majority of the population. Framing standard taxation as some kind of unprecedented attack on wealth feels a little out of touch.\u0022\n\nTo find more inspiration or data points for a reply, I can search for:\n"
