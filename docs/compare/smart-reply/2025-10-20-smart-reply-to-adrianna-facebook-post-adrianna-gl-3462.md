It\u0027s free to start and matches you quickly.\n- The Texas Bar Association\u0027s lawyer referral service (texasbar.com) can point you to vetted pros in Texas City/Houston area who do contingency work\u2014call 1-800-204-2222.\n- Firms like Baumgartner Law Firm in Houston focus heavily on personal injury and financial recovery on contingency; they\u0027ve got strong reviews for aggressive asset tracing.\n\nIf you\u0027re near Texas City, local options in Galveston County might be ideal for jurisdiction. Hope this gets you started\u2014feel free to DM if you need more specifics! Best of luck.",
