    "ChatGPT": "Absolutely, Cody! In a gold rush, it\u2019s not just about the nuggets but who gets them to market first and fastest. Product parity is real, but mastery in distribution creates the moat. Building the best pipeline, networks, and reach turns good ideas into lasting wins. Distribution isn\u2019t just a part of the game\u2014it\u2019s the game.",
    "Claude": "Here are some smart reply options:\n\n**Contrarian take:**\n\u0022Distribution without differentiation is just expensive noise. The companies winning long-term are still the ones solving problems others can\u0027t or won\u0027t solve.\u0022\n\n**Building on the analogy:**\n\u0022True, but in every gold rush, the real winners were selling shovels and maps - not just having better routes to market. Sometimes you need to change the game entirely.\u0022\n\n**Tactical agreement:**\n\u0022\uD83D\uDCAF Product-market fit is table stakes now. Distribution-market fit is the new moat. The question becomes: are you building distribution or renting it?\u0022\n\n**Historical perspective:**\n\u0022Same pattern every cycle. 2000: anyone could build a website. 2008: anyone could build an app. 2023: anyone can build AI features. Distribution always becomes the differentiator when building gets commoditized.\u0022\n\nChoose based on whether you want to challenge, amplify, or add nuance to his point.",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few smart reply options to Cody X\u0027s post, focusing on different angles:\n\n*   **Agreeing and expanding:** \u0022Totally agree, Cody. Distribution is king in this crowded market. It\u0027s not just about building the best mousetrap, but getting it into the hands of the most mice!\u0022\n*   **Adding a nuance:** \u0022Distribution is definitely critical. But a great product that solves a real problem *and* is well-distributed? That\u0027s the holy grail.\u0022\n*   **Questioning and engaging:** \u0022Interesting point, Cody! What are some underrated distribution strategies you\u0027re seeing work right now?\u0022\n*   **Short and punchy:** \u0022Spot on. Distribution = survival.\u0022\n*   **A bit provocative:** \u0022Hard disagree. Distribution gets you in the door, but a *bad* product ensures you don\u0027t stay long.\u0022 (Use with caution!)\n\nTo give you the *best* smart reply, it would be helpful to know:\n\n*   What kind of relationship do you have with Cody X? (Friend, acquaintance, mentor, etc.)\n*   What\u0027s your overall goal in replying? (Agree, debate, learn, promote yourself, etc.)\n*   Do you have any specific distribution strategies you want to mention or highlight?\n"
