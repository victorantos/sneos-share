    "ChatGPT": "This is impressive growth and a solid foundation\u2014especially with zero marketing spend! The organic traction from ChatGPT mentions and strong SEO rankings make Presentia AI a unique and valuable opportunity for anyone looking to scale an AI SaaS startup quickly. Wishing you the best in finding the right buyer to take it to the next level!",
    "Grok": "Sounds like an impressive organic ramp-up for just 8 months\u2014hitting 99K total users and \u00A32.3K MRR with zero ad spend is no small feat, especially in the AI space where ChatGPT tailwinds are real but fleeting. Congrats on the traction!\n\nQuick questions to gauge fit:\n- What\u0027s the core product? (E.g., is it an AI tool for presentations, content gen, or something else? A brief overview would help contextualize the user engagement.)\n- Any insights on churn rate or LTV:CAC? With 508 actives out of 99K total, retention seems key for scaling.\n- Tech stack and handover details? (E.g., is it built on no-code/low-code, or full custom? Any IP concerns?)\n- Asking price range? Ballpark would be great for serious folks.\n\nDMing support@presentia.ai shortly\u2014excited to learn more if it aligns. Best of luck with the transition!",
