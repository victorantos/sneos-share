  prompt="smart reply to Aaron Levie X post: An easy way to think through how processes should be re-engineered in a world of AI agents is to figure out where have there been constraints in a workflow due to human time being available. &#10;&#10;Vinod Khosla had an interesting way of thinking about this which is that we’ve designed so much of our work to ration scarce resources within the enterprise. So many of our processes are designed to ensure the most expensive doctors, engineers, researchers, marketers, designers, or lawyers are only used at the most critical moments.&#10;&#10;But what happens when that level of expertise becomes available on-demand at any point in a process. AI agents effectively let us bring these scarce resources to anyone, on demand, and at the price of the previously cheapest resource.&#10;&#10;Most of our work hasn’t been rewired yet to benefit from that change yet. And the teams and companies that figure this out first will stand to gain the most from AI."

    "Grok": "Hey Aaron, spot on! AI agents can truly democratize expertise, breaking down barriers of cost and time. The real challenge is rethinking workflows to integrate this on-demand capability seamlessly. Companies that adapt quickly to this paradigm shift will redefine efficiency and innovation. Excited to see how this unfolds! #AI #WorkflowRevolution",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few smart reply options to Aaron Levie\u0027s X post:\n\n*   \u0022Great point, Aaron! It\u0027s all about identifying those bottlenecks created by limited human availability and then unleashing AI to democratize expertise and reshape workflows.\u0022\n*   \u0022Really insightful, Aaron. Vinod Khosla\u0027s perspective on rationing scarce resources is spot on. AI truly has the potential to level the playing field.\u0022\n*   \u0022Totally agree, Aaron. Companies that proactively redesign their processes to leverage on-demand AI expertise will be the ones that thrive in the future.\u0022\n*   \u0022This is a game-changer, Aaron. Rethinking workflows with AI agents in mind will unlock unprecedented efficiency and innovation.\u0022\n*   \u0022Excellent food for thought, Aaron! The key is to rewire our work to fully capitalize on the availability of on-demand AI expertise.\u0022\n",
    "Claude": "This is a brilliant reframing. We\u0027ve spent decades optimizing workflows around *scarcity* - building elaborate triage systems to protect our most skilled people from routine decisions.\n\nBut AI flips this entirely. Instead of \u0022How do we minimize senior engineer time?\u0022 it becomes \u0022How do we maximize the intelligent decisions made throughout the process?\u0022\n\nThe companies winning early are those demolishing their careful rationing systems and flooding every touchpoint with expertise. The constraint was never the work itself - it was always the humans."
