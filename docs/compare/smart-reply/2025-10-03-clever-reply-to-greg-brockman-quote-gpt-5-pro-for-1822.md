    "ChatGPT": "\u0022Finally, a GPT that can spot my \u2018creative\u2019 citations before my professor does\u2014academic integrity, upgraded!\u0022",
    "Claude": "Here are a few clever replies to that concept:\n\n**The Academic\u0027s Dilemma:**\n\u0022Great! Now I can have an AI catch the subtle errors that another AI probably introduced in the first place. It\u0027s like having a spell-checker for your spell-checker.\u0022\n\n**The Meta Approach:**\n\u0022Finally, an AI sophisticated enough to tell me my thesis has a dangling participle while completely missing that I\u0027ve accidentally cited my own unpublished thoughts as Shakespeare.\u0022\n\n**The Existential Take:**\n\u0022Perfect timing - just as academics master the art of making original mistakes, we get an AI that specializes in catching the conventional ones.\u0022\n\n**The Practical Reality:**\n\u0022Can\u0027t wait for the day when my acknowledgments section is longer than my paper: \u0027Thanks to GPT-4 for writing this, GPT-5 Pro for fact-checking it, and GPT-6 for explaining to me what I apparently meant to say.\u0027\u0022\n\nWhich style resonates with you, or would you prefer a different angle?",
    "Gemini": "Please provide the Greg Brockman quote you\u0027re referring to. I need the quote to formulate a clever reply. Once you provide the quote, I can also brainstorm some ideas about how a hypothetical GPT-5 Pro could be used to catch subtle errors in academic work.\n"
