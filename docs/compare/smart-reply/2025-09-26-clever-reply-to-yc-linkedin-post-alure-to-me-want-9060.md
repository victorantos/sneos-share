  prompt="clever reply to YC linkedin post, alure to me wanting to work for this startup somehow: Alguna has raised $4M to build a native monetization platform for AI, SaaS, and fintech companies — replacing the patchwork of single-point tools for pricing, quoting, billing, invoicing, and revenue recognition.&#10;&#10;Over the past year, Alguna has helped scaling companies launch new pricing models in minutes,  eliminate revenue gaps, and unify finance, sales, and product on a single system of record.&#10;&#10;Founded by Aleks Đekić and Jamie MacLeod, Alguna was built from the ground up for modern revenue models — usage, credits, outcomes, and hybrids — instead of retrofitting old subscription tools. Changes flow automatically from pricing → quoting → billing → revenue recognition, fully integrated with CRM, ERP, payments, and accounting.&#10;&#10;Alguna is already powering real-time usage metering, consolidated invoicing, and ASC 606/IFRS-ready revenue recognition across multi-entity, multi-currency operations.&#10;&#10;The mission: end revenue leakage — projected to cost AI-driven businesses nearly $100B annually by 2030 — and give teams the flexibility to adapt pricing and scale with confidence.&#10;&#10;Congrats to the team on the round!&#10;&#10;https://lnkd.in/erDdC-bR"
