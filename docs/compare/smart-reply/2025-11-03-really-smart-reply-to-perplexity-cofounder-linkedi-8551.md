  prompt="really smart reply to Perplexity cofounder Linkedin post: Perplexity Comet is so good, just give it a task and&#10;let comet cook. I gave it access to my GitHub repo and asked it to set up a webhook to listen for push events, and it actually did it. It pulled the webhook URL from another tab, configured it correctly, selected the&#10;right event, and it worked perfectly."

As someone who\u0027s wrangled webhooks manually one too many times (hello, endless payload debugging), seeing it pull the URL cross-tab and nail the push event config without a hitch feels like the start of agents that truly own the dev workflow. What\u0027s the wildest repo automation you\u0027ve thrown at it next? Congrats on building something this game-changing! \uD83D\uDE80",
