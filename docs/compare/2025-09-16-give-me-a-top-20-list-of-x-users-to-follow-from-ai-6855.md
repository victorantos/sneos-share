    "Gemini": "I can provide you with a list of influential AI experts to follow on X (formerly Twitter). Note that influence can be subjective and difficult to measure. The suggestions below are based on a combination of factors, including their contributions to the field, engagement, and presence on X.\n\nHere is a list of some X users in the AI field to follow:\n\n1.  **Allie K.

    "Grok": "Creating a list of lesser-known but highly influential AI experts on X (formerly Twitter) can be challenging due to the subjective nature of \u0022lesser-known\u0022 and the dynamic landscape of social media presence. However, based on recent discussions, posts on X, and insights from web sources about influential figures in AI, I\u2019ve compiled a list of 20 individuals who have made significant contributions to the field but may not be as widely recognized as household names like Geoffrey Hinton or Yann LeCun. These individuals are often cited for their impactful work behind the scenes, innovative research, or contributions to major AI breakthroughs. Note that \u0022lesser-known\u0022 is relative\u2014some may have a growing following, but they are not yet mainstream celebrities in the AI space.\n\nBelow is the list with direct links to their X profiles where available. If a profile link isn\u2019t active or publicly available, I\u2019ve noted their contributions based on credible mentions. This list draws from sentiment and mentions on X as well as broader web information about AI contributors.\n\n1. **Alec Radford** - Often credited with driving key developments at OpenAI, including work on language models.
