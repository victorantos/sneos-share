  prompt="critical reply to Paul Graham essay from 2019 shared on Linkedin by YC today, be brutally honest opinion, here it is: Novelty and Heresy&#10;&#10;November 2019&#10;&#10;If you discover something new, there's a significant chance you'll be accused of some form of heresy.&#10;&#10;To discover new things, you have to work on ideas that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is obviously good, other people are probably already working on it. One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it. And you will thus get a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon, but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new ideas.&#10;&#10;So it's particularly dangerous for an organization or society to have a culture of pouncing on heresy. When you suppress heresies, you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistaken assumption you're trying to protect. You also suppress any idea that implies indirectly that it's false.&#10;&#10;Every cherished mistaken assumption has a dead zone of unexplored ideas around it. And the more preposterous the assumption, the bigger the dead zone it creates.&#10;&#10;There is a positive side to this phenomenon though. If you're looking for new ideas, one way to find them is by looking for heresies. When you look at the question this way, the depressingly large dead zones around mistaken assumptions become excitingly large mines of new ideas."

    "ChatGPT": "Paul Graham\u2019s essay \u201CNovelty and Heresy\u201D touches on an interesting and important theme about innovation and resistance to new ideas. However, while the essay is thought-provoking, it is also somewhat simplistic and overlooks crucial nuances that deserve a critical examination.\n\nFirstly, the framing of \u201Cheresy\u201D as a near-inevitable response to novelty feels romanticized. While it is historically true that figures like Galileo and Darwin faced opposition, equating all resistance to new ideas as heresy overstates the case. In many instances, skepticism towards new ideas is not a prejudiced defense of \u201Cmistaken assumptions\u201D but a necessary and rational filter to separate promising concepts from poor, unproven, or harmful ones. Innovation is not inherently virtuous merely because it is countercultural or challenges norms. Some ideas deserve to be rejected precisely because they are bad, misguided, or based on flawed reasoning\u2014not just because they are unpopular.\n\nSecondly, the essay assumes a binary worldview: ideas are either heretical but valuable or accepted but mistaken. The reality is far messier. Many so-called \u201Cheretical\u201D ideas fail not because of institutional resistance but due to lack of empirical evidence, practical feasibility, or logical coherence. By romanticizing heresy, Graham risks encouraging contrarianism for its own sake, a mindset that can lead to chasing novelty without discipline or rigor.\n\nThirdly, the depiction of \u201Cdead zones\u201D around cherished assumptions is intriguing but vague. The essay doesn\u2019t sufficiently grapple with how organizations or societies can constructively distinguish between protecting valuable frameworks and dogmatically suppressing innovation. It overlooks the practical mechanisms\u2014peer review, evidence-based debate, iterative testing\u2014that help balance skepticism with openness. Without addressing how to navigate this balance, the essay offers little actionable insight.\n\nLastly, the essay could do more to acknowledge that innovation often requires more than just identifying heresy. It requires building credible evidence, persuading stakeholders, scaling solutions, and sometimes, patience. Discovering \u201Chidden\u201D ideas is only the starting point; the hard work lies in making them withstand scrutiny and deliver real value.\n\nIn summary, while Paul Graham\u2019s essay captures an evocative narrative about challenging orthodoxies, it oversimplifies the complex dynamics of innovation, downplays the legitimate reasons for skepticism, and doesn\u2019t provide a robust framework for how to discern and foster truly valuable new ideas. It risks glamorizing being \u201Cwrong\u201D as an inherent part of being \u201Cright,\u201D which is not necessarily a healthy or productive mindset for innovators or organizations.",
    "Grok": "Here\u0027s a brutally honest critical reply to Paul Graham\u0027s 2019 essay \u0022Novelty and Heresy,\u0022 as shared by Y Combinator on LinkedIn today:\n\n---\n\nPaul Graham\u2019s essay \u0022Novelty and Heresy\u0022 offers a familiar refrain: innovation often stems from challenging entrenched assumptions, and doing so invites accusations of heresy. While the core idea has merit, the piece feels more like a recycled platitude than a profound insight. Graham\u2019s argument\u2014that groundbreaking ideas are often hidden behind mistaken assumptions and that societies or organizations that suppress heresy stifle progress\u2014reads as a surface-level observation dressed up with historical name-drops like Galileo and Darwin. These examples, while iconic, are overused to the point of clich\u00E9, and they fail to add depth to his point. Most readers already know that paradigm shifts face resistance; we don\u2019t need another reminder.\n\nThe essay\u2019s biggest flaw is its lack of specificity or actionable insight. Graham vaguely warns against cultures that \u201Cpounce on heresy\u201D but doesn\u2019t explore what that looks like in a modern context or how to navigate it. Are we talking about corporate groupthink, academic dogma, or social media cancel culture? He doesn\u2019t say. His suggestion to \u201Clook for heresies\u201D as a source of new ideas sounds clever but is ultimately hollow\u2014how does one systematically identify a heresy without already knowing the mistaken assumption? It\u2019s a circular problem he doesn\u2019t address. And while he gestures at the \u201Cdead zones\u201D of unexplored ideas around bad assumptions, he offers no framework for mapping or exploring them. It\u2019s all abstract hand-waving.\n\nMoreover, Graham\u2019s tone carries a whiff of self-congratulation, as if merely pointing out the existence of heresy makes one a bold thinker. This feels particularly ironic coming from someone embedded in the tech startup ecosystem, where \u201Cdisruption\u201D is practically a religion. If anything, the modern equivalent of heresy isn\u2019t always suppressed\u2014it\u2019s often fetishized, with every wannabe innovator claiming to challenge the status quo while chasing VC dollars. Graham ignores how the pendulum can swing too far the other way, where contrarianism for its own sake becomes a lazy shortcut to seeming innovative, often producing more noise than value.\n\nFinally, the essay feels dated even for 2019, let alone 2023. The dynamics of ideas, assumptions, and resistance have evolved with the internet\u2019s amplification of echo chambers and misinformation. Heresy today isn\u2019t just about challenging scientific or cultural dogma\u2014it\u2019s often about navigating a landscape where \u201Cmistaken assumptions\u201D are weaponized for political or economic gain. Graham\u2019s piece doesn\u2019t engage with this complexity, sticking to a sanitized, almost academic view of intellectual rebellion.\n\nIn short, while the essay isn\u2019t wrong, it\u2019s shallow and uninspired. It\u2019s the kind of thing you nod along to before forgetting it entirely. If Y Combinator is resharing this now, I hope it\u2019s to spark discussion rather than to suggest it\u2019s a timeless gem. We need sharper, more contextual thinking about innovation and resistance in today\u2019s world\u2014not reheated truisms.\n\n---\n\nThis critique aims to be direct and honest, focusing on the essay\u2019s lack of depth, relevance, and actionable insight while acknowledging the basic validity of its premise. Let me know if you\u0027d like me to adjust the tone or focus!",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a brutally honest critique of Paul Graham\u0027s \u0022Novelty and Heresy\u0022 essay:\n\n**Core Argument:** Graham argues that new ideas often face resistance because they challenge cherished, but mistaken, assumptions. He suggests that organizations which suppress \u0022heresies\u0022 stifle innovation and that exploring these \u0022heresies\u0022 is a fertile ground for new ideas.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n*   **Oversimplification of Resistance:** The essay paints a picture where resistance to new ideas *solely* stems from attachments to mistaken assumptions. This is a convenient, but ultimately naive, perspective. Resistance also arises from:\n    *   **Inherent Risk Aversion:** People and organizations are often incentivized to maintain the status quo. New ideas, even good ones, represent risk, disruption, and the potential for failure.\n    *   **Resource Constraints:** Implementing new ideas requires resources (time, money, effort). Even if an idea is recognized as valuable, there might not be the capacity to pursue it.\n    *   **Political Considerations:** New ideas can threaten existing power structures or vested interests within an organization. Resistance can be a deliberate tactic to protect those interests.\n    *   **Genuine Disagreement:** Not every \u0022heresy\u0022 is a brilliant insight. Some ideas are simply bad, impractical, or based on flawed reasoning. Dismissing all resistance as stemming from \u0022mistaken assumptions\u0022 is intellectually lazy.\n*   **Elitism and the \u0022Lone Genius\u0022 Trope:** The essay subtly reinforces the idea of the lone genius battling against the ignorant masses. While it\u0027s true that groundbreaking thinkers often face opposition, the essay doesn\u0027t acknowledge the collaborative and iterative nature of innovation. New ideas are rarely born in a vacuum; they build upon existing knowledge and require feedback and refinement.\n*   **Lack of Practical Application:** While the essay identifies a potential source of new ideas (challenging assumptions), it offers little in the way of *how* to do this effectively. How do you distinguish between a valuable \u0022heresy\u0022 and a crackpot theory? How do you navigate the inevitable resistance? The essay remains at a high level of abstraction, making it difficult to translate into concrete action.\n*   **Potential for Justifying Bad Ideas:** The framing could be misused to justify poorly thought-out or even harmful ideas. Someone could claim their idea is being unfairly suppressed due to \u0022heresy,\u0022 even if it lacks merit.\n*   **Ignoring the Importance of Incremental Innovation:** The focus on radical \u0022heresies\u0022 undervalues the importance of incremental improvements and optimizations within existing paradigms. Not all valuable innovation requires overturning established assumptions.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nGraham\u0027s essay has a kernel of truth: challenging assumptions can lead to new insights. However, it presents an oversimplified view of innovation and resistance, neglecting the complex interplay of risk aversion, resource constraints, political considerations, and the collaborative nature of progress. It risks being interpreted as a justification for contrarianism for its own sake, rather than a call for rigorous and well-supported challenges to existing ideas. It is an interesting thought piece, but lacks practical applicability and ignores crucial aspects of how innovation *actually* works.\n\nTo find some external opinions about the Paul Graham\u0027s essay, I will search for:\n"
