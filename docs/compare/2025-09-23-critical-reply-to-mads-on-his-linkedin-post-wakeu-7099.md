  prompt="critical reply to Mads on his Linkedin post, wakeup call: Coding is a high-paying career, and that's an excellent reason to get started with code.&#10;&#10;But let's be realistic: You won't find a career overnight.&#10;&#10;You can't learn to code in 5 hours, 5 days or 5 weeks. &#10;&#10;The job market is also especially tough for junior developers right now.&#10;&#10;It might be tempting to give it all up - especially if you have many obligations that take a lot of your focus. But if possible, I would try to stick it out and continue learning.&#10;&#10;Coding is one of the most satisfying careers I can imagine, and I'm hoping the job market for new devs will turn soon (ðŸ¤ž). &#10;&#10;Cause once you land that first job, you'll never regret learning to code.

    "ChatGPT": "Hi Mads,\n\nI appreciate your honest wakeup call about the realities of starting a career in coding. It\u2019s refreshing to see someone highlight that coding isn\u2019t a quick fix or an overnight success story. Too often, the narrative around tech careers paints an overly rosy picture that can set unrealistic expectations.\n\nYour point about the difficulty junior developers face in the current job market is especially important. Many newcomers underestimate how challenging it is to break in, particularly when balancing other life obligations. Persistence and continued learning are indeed crucial.\n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s also worth emphasizing that while coding is rewarding, success isn\u2019t guaranteed solely by sticking it out. Networking, building practical projects, and gaining real-world experience can often be just as important as time spent learning theory. The journey isn\u2019t just about \u201Csticking it out,\u201D but actively engaging with the community and opportunities.\n\nThanks for sharing a grounded perspective\u2014it\u2019s a much-needed reminder for those considering this path.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]",
    "Grok": "Hey Mads, I appreciate your enthusiasm for coding as a high-paying and satisfying career, and I agree that it\u2019s a fantastic field to pursue. However, I think it\u2019s important to temper the optimism with a bit more nuance. While coding can be lucrative, the path to getting there is often much longer and more challenging than many realize, especially for beginners. As you mentioned, learning to code takes significant time\u2014far beyond just a few hours, days, or weeks\u2014and the current job market for junior developers is indeed tough, with intense competition and fewer entry-level opportunities.\n\nI\u2019d also caution against framing coding as a guaranteed ticket to success. Not everyone who learns to code will land a job, even after years of effort, due to factors like market saturation, lack of experience, or inability to stand out in a crowded field. While persistence is key, it\u2019s equally important to acknowledge that some may need to pivot if their circumstances or goals change, especially if they\u2019re juggling heavy obligations.\n\nThat said, I do share your hope that the market for new developers improves soon. For those who can stick with it, coding can indeed be incredibly rewarding\u2014both intellectually and financially. But I think setting realistic expectations and preparing for a potentially long and bumpy road is crucial to avoid burnout or disillusionment. What strategies do you think aspiring coders can adopt to stay motivated during these challenging times?",
    "Gemini": "Okay, I understand. You want me to act as if I\u0027m replying to Mads\u0027 LinkedIn post with a critical but realistic counterpoint. Here\u0027s a draft of that reply:\n\n\u003EMads, while I agree that coding can be a lucrative career, I think it\u0027s important to add some realistic perspective for those considering this path. Saying it\u0027s a \u0022high-paying career\u0022 is true *eventually* for *some*, but it\u0027s not a guarantee, especially not immediately.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe truth is, landing a coding job takes time and effort. You\u0027re not going to be job-ready after a short online course. The market, especially for junior developers, is incredibly competitive right now. Many talented, dedicated people are struggling to find their first role.\n\u003E\n\u003EIt\u0027s easy to get discouraged, especially when balancing learning with other life commitments. But perseverance is key. If you can stick with it, the rewards can be significant. I truly believe that once you break through and land that first job, the journey will have been worth it. Let\u0027s hope the market improves soon for new developers!\n"
