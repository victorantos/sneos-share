Here's how to do it:\n\n1. **Soft Reset**: If you want to undo the last commit and move the changes to the staging area (index), you can use:\n   ```bash\n   git reset --soft HEAD~1\n   ```\n\n2. **Mixed Reset** (default behavior): If you want to undo the last commit and move the changes to the working directory (unstaged), use:\n   ```bash\n   git reset HEAD~1\n   ```\n   This is equivalent to `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`, but you can just use `git reset HEAD~1` since \"mixed\" is the default.\n\n3. **Hard Reset** (not what you want): Avoid this if you want to keep your changes, as it will delete all changes:\n   ```bash\n   git reset --hard HEAD~1\n   ```\n\n### Example of Usage\nAfter running the command `git reset HEAD~1`, your last commit will be undone, and the changes will be available to you either staged (with `--soft`) or unstaged (with the default `mixed`).\n\n### Check Your Status\nAfter the reset, you can check the status of your repository to see your changes:\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Make sure you haven’t pushed the commit yet or, if you have, ensure that you coordinate with others before changing commit history in shared branches. \n- If you have already pushed the commit, you'll need to force push (`git push --force`) after resetting, but be careful, as this can cause issues for others working on the same branch.",

            "text": "You have several options to undo the last Git commit without losing your changes. Here's a breakdown of the common methods, ranked from safest and most recommended to potentially more risky, along with explanations:\n\n**1. `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (Recommended)**\n\n   * **What it does:**  Moves the `HEAD` pointer back one commit (to the commit *before* the last one).  However, it leaves the changes from the undone commit staged (ready to be committed again) in the staging area (index).  Your working directory is untouched.\n\n   * **Why it's good:**  This is generally the safest and most flexible option. It's easy to inspect your changes, modify them if needed, and then recommit them with a new, potentially improved commit message.\n\n   * **How to use it:**\n      ```bash\n      git reset --soft HEAD~1\n      ```\n\n   * **Example:**\n\n      1.  You make a commit with a typo in the commit message.\n      2.  You run `git reset --soft HEAD~1`\n      3.  `git status` will show the changes from the undone commit as \"Changes to be committed\".\n      4.  You can then run `git commit -m \"Fixed typo in commit message\"` to recommit with the corrected message.\n\n**2. `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` (Default, but slightly less safe than `--soft`)**\n\n   * **What it does:** Moves the `HEAD` pointer back one commit *and* unstages the changes.  Your working directory is still untouched.\n\n   * **Why it's good:**  It's the default behavior of `git reset`, so you can omit the `--mixed` option.  It's useful if you want to completely rework the commit's contents.\n\n   * **How to use it:**\n      ```bash\n      git reset --mixed HEAD~1\n      # or simply\n      git reset HEAD~1\n      ```\n\n   * **Example:**\n\n      1.  You make a commit that includes a file you forgot to exclude.\n      2.  You run `git reset HEAD~1`\n      3.  `git status` will show the changes from the undone commit as \"Changes not staged for commit\".\n      4.  You can then `git add .gitignore` (assuming you didn't have one), `git add .`, and `git commit -m \"Fixed commit contents\"`\n\n**3. `git commit --amend` (If you haven't pushed the commit)**\n\n   * **What it does:**  If the last commit is the only one you want to modify, `git commit --amend` is the most direct option. It allows you to change the *contents* or the *message* of the last commit.  It essentially replaces the last commit with a new commit that includes the amended changes.\n\n   * **Why it's good:**  Simple and effective for quick fixes to the most recent commit.\n\n   * **Important:  DO NOT USE if you've already pushed the commit to a shared repository.**  Amending a pushed commit rewrites history, which will cause serious problems for anyone else who has already pulled that commit.\n\n   * **How to use it:**\n\n      * **To amend the commit message:**\n         ```bash\n         git commit --amend\n         ```\n         This will open your text editor, allowing you to change the commit message.  Save and close the editor to complete the amendment.\n\n      * **To amend the contents and the message:**\n         1.  Make any necessary changes to your working directory.\n         2.  Stage the changes you want to include in the amended commit:\n            ```bash\n            git add .  # Or add specific files\n            ```\n         3.  Run:\n            ```bash\n            git commit --amend\n            ```\n            This opens the editor, allowing you to change both the contents (because you staged new changes) and the commit message.\n\n   * **Example:**\n\n      1.  You make a commit, but immediately realize you forgot to add a file.\n      2.  You `git add` the missing file.\n      3.  You run `git commit --amend`\n      4.  Your editor opens, allowing you to update the commit message if needed.\n\n**4. `git revert HEAD` (Safest option if you've already pushed)**\n\n   * **What it does:** Creates a *new* commit that *undoes* the changes introduced by the last commit.  It doesn't rewrite history.\n\n   * **Why it's good:**  Safe to use even if you've already pushed the commit. It's the *only* safe option in that case. It preserves the history and makes it clear that you intentionally reverted the changes.\n\n   * **How to use it:**\n      ```bash\n      git revert HEAD\n      ```\n      This will usually open your editor, prompting you for a commit message for the revert commit.\n\n   * **Example:**\n\n      1.  You push a commit to a shared repository.\n      2.  You realize the commit introduced a bug.\n      3.  You run `git revert HEAD`\n      4.  Git creates a new commit that effectively removes the changes introduced by the previous commit.\n      5.  You push the revert commit.\n\n**Important Considerations and Warnings:**\n\n* **`HEAD`:**  `HEAD` is a pointer to the tip of your current branch (usually the most recent commit). `HEAD~1` means \"one commit before HEAD\". `HEAD~2` means \"two commits before HEAD\", and so on.\n\n* **Pushed Commits:**  Never, ever use `git reset` or `git commit --amend` on commits that have been pushed to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and that others may have already based work on.  Rewriting history that others rely on will create a nightmare for everyone.  Use `git revert` instead.\n\n* **Staging Area (Index):**  The staging area (also called the index) is where you prepare changes to be committed. `git add` puts changes into the staging area.  `git reset --mixed` unstages them.\n\n* **Working Directory:** This is the directory on your computer where you're working on the files.  `git reset` never touches your working directory unless you use the `--hard` option (which you should *avoid* unless you really know what you're doing).\n\n* **`git reset --hard` (Danger Zone!):**  This option is the most destructive. It resets your staging area *and* your working directory to match the specified commit.  Any changes in your staging area or working directory that weren't committed will be *permanently lost* unless you have a backup.  Use with extreme caution.  Specifically, *never* use it after pushing unless you are absolutely certain nobody else has pulled your changes.\n\n**Choosing the Right Method:**\n\n* **For minor corrections to the *last* commit that you haven't pushed:** `git commit --amend` is the simplest.\n* **For undoing the *last* commit to rework it (haven't pushed):** `git reset --soft HEAD~1` is generally preferred because it keeps your changes staged, making it easier to commit again.  `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` is also fine if you want to start from scratch.\n* **For undoing a commit that *has* been pushed (or you want a non-destructive approach):**  `git revert HEAD` is the *only* safe option.\n* **If you're unsure:** Start with `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.  It's the safest way to inspect your changes before deciding what to do next.\n\nIn summary, choose the method that best fits your situation and be mindful of whether or not your changes have been pushed to a shared repository. When in doubt, use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` or `git revert HEAD` as these are less destructive.\n"
