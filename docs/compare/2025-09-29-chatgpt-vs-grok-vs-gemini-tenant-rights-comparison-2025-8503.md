    "ChatGPT": "I\u0027m sorry to hear that you\u0027re dealing with an attempted illegal eviction. It\u0027s important to know your rights as a tenant so you can protect yourself and respond appropriately. Here are some key points to keep in mind and steps you can take:\n\n### Know Your Rights\n1. **Proper Notice is Required:**  \n   Landlords must give you proper written notice before beginning eviction proceedings. The notice period varies by location and reason for eviction (e.g., non-payment of rent, lease violation).\n\n2. **Eviction Must Go Through the Courts:**  \n   A landlord cannot forcibly remove you, shut off utilities, or change locks without a court order. Any attempt to do so is illegal.\n\n3. **Right to a Hearing:**  \n   If the landlord files for eviction, you have the right to present your case in court.\n\n4. **Protection from Retaliation:**  \n   Landlords cannot evict you in retaliation for complaining about housing conditions or exercising your legal rights.\n\n5. **Tenant\u2019s Right to Repairs and Habitability:**  \n   If the landlord is violating housing or health codes, you might have additional protections.\n\n### What You Can Do\n1. **Document Everything:**  \n   Keep copies of all notices, communication with your landlord, receipts for rent payments, and records of any issues with the property.\n\n2. **Don\u2019t Leave Without a Court Order:**  \n   If the landlord tries to force you out without a court process, call the police and inform them of illegal eviction.\n\n3. **Respond to Eviction Notices:**  \n   If you receive an eviction notice, respond promptly and consider seeking legal advice.\n\n4. **Seek Legal Assistance:**  \n   Contact local tenant rights organizations, housing agencies, or legal aid services. Many areas provide free or low-cost legal help for tenants.\n\n5. **Know Your Local Laws:**  \n   Tenant rights and eviction laws vary by state, city, and country. Research your local regulations.\n\n### Resources to Consider\n- Local tenant unions or advocacy groups  \n- Legal Aid organizations  \n- Housing courts or housing departments on your city\u2019s official website  \n- Online resources specific to your area\u2019s landlord-tenant laws  \n\n### Summary\n- Landlords cannot evict you illegally or without a court order.  \n- Know and exercise your rights.  \n- Document all interactions and communications.  \n- Seek legal help early.  \n- Do not vacate the premises until legally required.\n\nIf you tell me your location, I can help you find specific resources and laws that apply to your situation.",
