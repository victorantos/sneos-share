    "ChatGPT": "No, standard cars typically have four wheels. However, some specialized vehicles, such as certain types of trucks or custom-built vehicles, may have five wheels. Additionally, certain racing cars might have a spare wheel that could be considered an extra, but in conventional terms, regular passenger cars have four wheels.",
    "Claude": "No, cars typically have 4 wheels - one at each corner of the vehicle. However, if you count the spare tire (which is also a wheel), then you could say a car has 5 wheels total, though only 4 are used for driving at any given time.\n\nSome people do refer to the spare as the \u00225th wheel,\u0022 but in normal conversation, when we talk about how many wheels a car has, we mean the 4 that are mounted and in use.",
    "Gemini": "No, cars typically have **four** wheels. Some vehicles, like trucks or buses, can have more. A spare tire is often carried in the trunk, but it\u0027s not normally used unless one of the four main tires has a problem.\n"
