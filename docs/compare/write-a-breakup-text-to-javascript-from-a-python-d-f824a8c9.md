    "ChatGPT": "Hey JavaScript,\n\nI hope you\u0027re doing well. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about our relationship, and I feel it\u2019s time for us to go our separate ways. I really appreciate everything we\u2019ve built together, but I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m more aligned with Python these days. \n\nI love the simplicity, readability, and expressiveness that Python brings to my life. It feels like a better fit for me, especially with all the data projects I\u0027m diving into. \n\nI wish you all the best in your future endeavors \u2014 keep making the web more dynamic and interactive. \n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Claude": "Hey JavaScript,\n\nWe need to talk. This isn\u0027t easy for me to say, but I think it\u0027s time we went our separate ways.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong - you\u0027re exciting, dynamic, and you\u0027re literally everywhere these days. But I need something more... predictable in my life. I\u0027m tired of wondering if you meant \u0022==\u0022 or \u0022===\u0022 and honestly, your relationship with semicolons is just too complicated for me.\n\nI\u0027ve found someone new. Python. I know, I know - you probably think they\u0027re boring with all that indentation obsession, but there\u0027s something beautiful about code that reads like English. And their community... they have something called \u0022The Zen of Python.\u0022 When\u0027s the last time you offered me zen, JS?\n\nI\u0027ll always cherish our time together - those late nights debugging callbacks, the thrill of hoisting variables, the way you made everything asynchronous. But I need someone who won\u0027t let me accidentally create global variables or add arrays to objects without warning.\n\nThis isn\u0027t about your frameworks (though there are... a lot of them). It\u0027s about me. I need explicit over implicit, readability over cleverness.\n\nI hope we can still be friends. Maybe I\u0027ll see you around in some Node projects.\n\nStay dynamic,\nA Python developer \uD83D\uDC0D\n\nP.S. Please tell TypeScript I said hi. We had something good.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a breakup text from a Python developer to JavaScript, playing on some of the common sentiments and inside jokes:\n\n**Option 1 (Direct and Slightly Sass-Filled):**\n\n\u003E Hey JS, it\u0027s Python.  Look, we\u0027ve had some good times, but I think we need to talk. Your flexibility is cool, but all those weird edge cases and \u0022truthy\u0022 values are giving me a headache.  I need a language that\u0027s a bit more... explicit. It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s \u0060import this\u0060.  Best of luck with Node.js. \uD83D\uDC0D\uD83D\uDC94\n\n**Option 2 (More Empathetic, Less \u0022Burn\u0022):**\n\n\u003E JS, Python here. This is tough, but I think it\u0027s time we go our separate ways.  I admire your front-end prowess and ecosystem, but honestly, I\u0027m finding myself drawn to simpler, more readable things. I need a language where I spend less time debugging and more time, well, doing actual work.  I\u0027ll always remember the good times (like that one time we made a cool animation), but it\u0027s over. \uD83D\uDC0D\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\n\n**Option 3 (A Bit More Comedic):**\n\n\u003E JavaScript, listen, this isn\u0027t easy. We\u0027re breaking up. I\u0027m tired of constantly Googling \u0022how to do X in JavaScript\u0022 and getting 17 different answers, all of which involve a different framework and 300MB of dependencies.  My code deserves better than callback hell and asynchronous confusion.  Maybe we can still be friends... but I doubt it.  Bye. \uD83D\uDC0D\u270C\uFE0F\n\n**Option 4 (Focus on Syntax and Readability):**\n\n\u003E Hey JavaScript, Python here. I need to be honest. I can\u0027t keep overlooking the syntax anymore. All the semicolons, curly braces, and \u0060var\u0060 vs. \u0060let\u0060 vs. \u0060const\u0060 is just too much. I\u0027m craving the simplicity and readability of Python\u0027s whitespace and clear structure. It\u0027s over. No hard feelings (maybe). \uD83D\uDC0D\uD83D\uDC4B\n\n**Why these work:**\n\n*   **Referential:** They all allude to common issues Python developers have with JavaScript (truthy values, edge cases, frameworks, syntax).\n*   **Python-Centric:** They use the snake emoji (\uD83D\uDC0D) to emphasize the Python developer\u0027s perspective.\n*   **Tone:** They range in tone from slightly sarcastic to understanding, so you can choose the one that best fits the (imaginary) relationship.\n*   **Humor:** They inject a bit of humor to lighten the mood.\n\nChoose the one you like best, or modify it to your liking!  Good luck with your (fictional) breakup! \uD83D\uDE04\n"
