  prompt="reply to Joram he mentioned the post was more satire than truth and my initial reply was taking it more serious, anyway here the original post from Aleks: I became Senior VP at a multi-million dollar company at age 26. My salary was $600k. This was in 2018.&#10;&#10;How did I do it?&#10;&#10;It wasnâ€™t hustle culture. No 5:30am wakeups, cold showers, or productivity hacks.&#10;&#10;What got me there was a relentless focus on impact. Every project I touched, every deck I built, every presentation I gave MOVED THE NEEDLE.&#10;&#10;Always, I asked myself: what is the single most valuable contribution I can make to the company right now? And I did that. If people disagreed, I convinced them otherwise.&#10;&#10;I kept this up for three years before the CEO (my dad) finally recognized my results and promoted me to SVP.&#10;&#10;There are no gimmicks. There are no shortcuts.&#10;&#10;To get ahead, create value."

    "ChatGPT": "Hi Joram,\n\nThanks for pointing that out\u2014I realize now that I took Aleks\u2019 post a bit too literally at first. It definitely reads more like satire, especially with the CEO being his dad and that $600k salary at 26. Still, I think the core message about focusing on creating real impact and value is worth reflecting on, even if the story is exaggerated. Appreciate your perspective!",
    "Grok": "Hey Joram, thanks for pointing out the satirical tone of Aleks\u0027 post. I initially took it at face value and responded more seriously, but now I see the humor\u2014especially with the twist about the CEO being his dad! Appreciate the heads-up, and I\u2019ll keep the lighter tone in mind next time. \uD83D\uDE0A What did you think of the underlying message about creating value, though? Satire aside, I think there\u2019s still a solid point there.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, Joram, thanks for pointing out the satirical nature of Aleks\u0027s post. I definitely took it at face value initially. The part about the CEO being his dad... that makes a lot more sense now! I appreciate you clarifying.\n"
