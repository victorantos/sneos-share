It is anticipated to replace the "Plus" variant, focusing on a super-thin and lightweight design, potentially appealing to users who prioritize portability without sacrificing flagship features.

  'Claude': `I don't have any confirmed information about an "iPhone 17 Air" as this appears to be a rumored or speculated device that hasn't been officially announced by Apple.

As of my last update, Apple's iPhone lineup typically includes standard, Plus/Pro, and Pro Max models, but there hasn't been an official "Air" variant in the iPhone line (though Apple does use "Air" branding for iPads and MacBooks).

Since I don't have access to real-time information, I can't provide current pricing or confirm whether such a device has been announced. For the most up-to-date and accurate information about Apple's current iPhone lineup and pricing, I'd recommend:

- Checking Apple's official website
- Looking at recent tech news from reliable sources
- Visiting authorized Apple retailers
