    "Gemini": "Perplexity AI was founded in August 2022 by a quartet of engineers: Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. These individuals brought diverse and strong backgrounds in back-end systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to the venture.\n\nAravind Srinivas, the CEO and co-founder, previously held research positions at prominent AI organizations such as OpenAI, Google Brain, and DeepMind. Denis Yarats, the Chief Technology Officer, was an AI research scientist at Meta. Johnny Ho, the Chief Strategy Officer, worked as an engineer at Quora, and Andy Konwinski, a president and board member, was part of the founding team at Databricks.\n\nThe genesis of Perplexity AI stemmed from a shared frustration among the founders regarding the limitations of traditional search engines. They observed that existing search technologies often provided endless lists of links rather than direct, contextual answers to complex queries. Their vision was to build a \u0022conversational answer engine\u0022 that could deliver precise answers supported by evidence and source citations. Srinivas described this core vision as building \u0022the world\u0027s first generally available conversational answer engine that directly answers questions about any topic.\u0022\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, Perplexity AI officially launched its main search engine on December 7, 2022. The company aimed to integrate large language models (LLMs) into the search process to provide conversational and context-aware results. Perplexity AI\u0027s platform is designed to provide direct, detailed answers to user queries, incorporating real-time web search capabilities and citing the sources used. The company positions itself as an alternative to traditional advertising-driven search engine models, focusing on straightforward and efficient information retrieval.",
    "Grok": "### The Founding Story of Perplexity AI\n\nPerplexity AI, often just called Perplexity, emerged as one of the most ambitious challengers to traditional search engines like Google in the early days of the generative AI boom. Founded in August 2022 and headquartered in San Francisco, California, the company set out to reinvent how people discover information\u2014not by serving up endless lists of links, but by delivering direct, conversational answers powered by large language models (LLMs). Its name draws from a key concept in natural language processing: \u0022perplexity\u0022 measures how well a model predicts a sample, symbolizing the company\u0027s goal to reduce the confusion and complexity of searching for knowledge.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Aravind Srinivas, the Indian-born CEO and co-founder, whose journey reads like a classic Silicon Valley origin tale infused with AI ambition. Born in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, in the late 1990s, Srinivas grew up idolizing tech leaders like Sundar Pichai (Google\u0027s CEO, also from Chennai). He pursued engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, where he honed his passion for machine learning. After graduating, he headed to the U.S. for a PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley, under the guidance of renowned AI researcher Ion Stoica. During his time at Berkeley, Srinivas interned at top AI labs: DeepMind in London, Google Brain, and OpenAI. These experiences exposed him to cutting-edge work in reinforcement learning and natural language processing, but they also frustrated him. He saw how powerful AI models were being built, yet everyday search remained clunky\u2014dominated by ads and irrelevant results.\n\nThe spark for Perplexity came during Srinivas\u0027s PhD days around 2021\u20132022. Frustrated with the limitations of existing search tools, he began sketching ideas for an \u0022answer engine\u0022 that could synthesize information from the web in real-time, cite sources transparently, and engage users conversationally, much like chatting with an expert. He often bounced ideas off his Berkeley lab mates, including Peter Chen, and dreamed of building something beyond academic papers. \u0022I didn\u0027t want to just write great research\u2014I wanted to create a product that changes how people learn,\u0022 Srinivas later reflected in interviews.\n\nSrinivas wasn\u0027t alone in this vision. He teamed up with three co-founders who brought complementary expertise:\n\n- **Denis Yarats**, the CTO, a former researcher at Meta AI and NYU, specializing in deep learning and computer vision. Yarats had worked on scalable AI systems, which became crucial for Perplexity\u0027s backend.\n  \n- **Johnny Ho**, an early engineer with experience at Quora and Pinterest, focused on product design and user interfaces to make the AI feel intuitive and approachable.\n\n- **Andy Konwinski**, a co-founder with a background in big data from co-founding Databricks (a unicorn in data analytics). He helped architect the infrastructure to handle Perplexity\u0027s massive web queries efficiently.\n\nThe quartet bootstrapped the company with a small seed round from investors like Elad Gil (a prominent Silicon Valley backer) and Jeff Bezos\u0027s Bezos Expeditions. They launched the beta in late 2022 from a modest office in San Francisco\u0027s SoMa district, amid the explosive hype around tools like ChatGPT. Perplexity\u0027s debut was simple: a clean web app where users could ask questions in natural language\u2014\u0022What\u0027s the best way to learn Python?\u0022\u2014and get synthesized answers with inline citations from web sources. Unlike pure chatbots, it emphasized accuracy and verifiability, pulling from real-time web data rather than just pre-trained knowledge.\n\nEarly challenges were plentiful. The team iterated rapidly on the core LLM integration (initially using models like GPT from OpenAI, later diversifying to custom fine-tuned versions). Funding poured in quickly\u2014$26 million in Series A by May 2023, valuing the company at $520 million\u2014fueled by endorsements from AI luminaries like Yann LeCun. But growth brought scrutiny: By 2024, Perplexity faced lawsuits from publishers like The New York Times and Dow Jones, accusing it of scraping content without permission. Srinivas defended the approach as \u0022aggregation\u0022 rather than plagiarism, emphasizing fair use for transformative AI.\n\nToday, as of late 2025, Perplexity has evolved into a $3 billion\u002B powerhouse with over 10 million monthly users, expanding into enterprise tools (like the 2024 acquisition of Carbon for internal search) and premium features like Perplexity Pro. What started as a Berkeley PhD side project has positioned Srinivas in a direct rivalry with his idol Pichai, as Perplexity chips away at Google\u0027s search dominance. As Srinivas puts it, \u0022We\u0027re building the search engine for the AI age\u2014one truthful answer at a time.\u0022\n\nThis story draws from public accounts in sources like Wikipedia, Wired, and Contrary Research, highlighting Perplexity\u0027s roots in academic innovation and bold disruption.
