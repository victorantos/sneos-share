  prompt="critical reply on X to Trump president, be brutally honest: It was a great honor to speak before the United Nations. I believe the speech was very well received. It focused very much on energy and migration/immigration. I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this Forum, was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements. I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden hault as we were ridding up to the podium, but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise. It is always an honor to speak at the United Nations, even if, their equipment is somewhat faulty.&#10;Make America Great Again!"

    "ChatGPT": "Brutally honest response:\n\nIt\u0027s honestly baffling that you would call this speech \u0022the absolute best\u0022 without acknowledging the glaring lack of substance and coherence. Focusing on energy and migration might sound important on the surface, but your approach has consistently been shallow, divisive, and lacking any meaningful solutions. Claiming the teleprompter breaking and escalator halting made the speech more interesting feels like an excuse to cover up poor preparation and delivery. Speaking at the United Nations is indeed an honor, but the quality of the message is what truly matters\u2014not the spectacle or technical glitches. If your goal was to advance meaningful global dialogue, this speech fell far short. Instead, it came across as self-aggrandizing and disconnected from the complex realities the world faces.",
    "Grok": "Here is a critical reply on X to President Trump\u0027s post about his United Nations speech, maintaining a brutally honest tone as requested:\n\n---\n\n@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, with all due respect, your UN speech was a rambling mess that alienated allies and embarrassed the U.S. on a global stage. Your focus on energy and immigration came across as divisive fear-mongering, not leadership. Claiming it was \u2018very well received\u2019 feels detached from reality\u2014reports suggest it was met with criticism for lacking substance and diplomacy. Blaming broken equipment for the speech\u2019s impact is a weak excuse; the content, not the teleprompter, was the issue. The UN isn\u2019t a rally crowd\u2014self-praise and excuses don\u2019t cut it here. America deserves better representation. #UNSpeech #Leadership\n\n---\n\nThis reply reflects a critical perspective based on recent news coverage indicating negative feedback on the speech\u2019s tone and content, as reported by sources like CBC News and Alternet.org. It avoids directly quoting specific articles or posts while addressing the key points Trump highlighted\u2014energy, migration/immigration, and equipment issues\u2014 with a sharp, honest tone suitable for a public platform like X.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here are a few brutally honest critical replies to Trump\u0027s post on X, playing on different angles:\n\n**Reply 1 (Focusing on the \u0022well-received\u0022 claim):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Well received\u0022? By whom, exactly? The fossil fuel lobbyists and xenophobes? The UN is a place for diplomacy, not a campaign rally for your outdated energy policies and fear-mongering about immigrants. Maybe focus on facts instead of patting yourself on the back. #UNGA #MAGA #Delusional\n\n**Reply 2 (Focusing on the broken equipment):**\n\n\u003E \u0022Ah yes, the broken teleprompter and escalator. The perfect metaphor for your entire presidency. Always blaming external factors for your own incompetence. Maybe if you focused on fixing real problems instead of complaining about the UN\u0027s \u0027faulty equipment,\u0027 you\u0027d have a legacy to be proud of. #UNGA #Excuses #MAGA\u0022\n\n**Reply 3 (Playing on the \u0022honor\u0022 of speaking):**\n\n\u003E \u0022It\u0027s an \u0027honor\u0027 to speak at the UN? Then maybe show some respect for the institution and the complex global challenges it addresses. Your speech boiled down to pushing your personal agenda on energy and demonizing immigrants. The UN deserves better than to be your personal soapbox. #UNGA #AmericaFirstButAtWhatCost #MAGA\u0022\n\n**Reply 4 (Sarcastic and Direct):**\n\n\u003E \u0022The absolute BEST forum for your \u0027important statements\u0027? Please. The world is laughing at you. Your energy policies are a joke, and your immigration rhetoric is dangerous. The broken teleprompter was probably a sign. #UNGA #MAGA #Embarrassing\u0022\n\nTo make these replies even more impactful, you could add a relevant image or GIF. For example, a GIF of someone facepalming, or a picture highlighting the negative consequences of Trump\u0027s policies.\n"
