    "ChatGPT": "Honestly, Stable Audio 2.5 feels like a minor incremental update rather than a breakthrough. Claims about \u0022improved musical structure\u0022 are vague without concrete examples, and the real audio quality still lags behind more established tools. \u0022Faster inference\u0022 is nice, but sub-2 seconds on a GPU is barely impressive given how far hardware has come. Audio inpainting is an interesting feature but feels underdeveloped and spotty in practice. Overall, this release feels more like catching up than leading\u2014if you\u2019re aiming for professional, enterprise-grade audio production, Stable Audio still has a long way to go before it\u2019s genuinely competitive. The best practices guide is thorough, but it often reads like a workaround manual to fix the model\u2019s current weaknesses rather than a celebration of real progress.",
    "Grok": "Here\u0027s a brutally honest and critical reply to Stability AI\u0027s X post about Stable Audio 2.5. I\u2019ve aimed to provide constructive criticism while addressing potential shortcomings based on general concerns about AI audio models and enterprise-grade tools, as specific user feedback or detailed reviews of Stable Audio 2.5 are limited in the provided context.\n\n---\n\n@StabilityAI While the release of Stable Audio 2.5 sounds promising with its \u0022enterprise-grade\u0022 focus and faster inference, I\u2019m skeptical about whether it truly delivers for professional use cases. Improved musical structure and audio inpainting are nice buzzwords, but does it actually produce audio that can compete with human composers for advertising or game soundtracks? Most AI audio tools still struggle with nuanced emotion and originality\u2014key elements for impactful sound design. \n\nAlso, \u0022effective prompting techniques\u0022 feel like a cop-out. If the model requires extensive user guidance to get decent results, it\u2019s not as revolutionary as claimed. Enterprises need plug-and-play solutions, not a steep learning curve. And let\u2019s talk accessibility\u2014less than 2 seconds on a GPU is great, but what about cost and hardware barriers for smaller studios or indie creators who might want to use this for short-form video? \n\nI\u2019ll check out the guide, but I hope it addresses real-world flaws and limitations instead of just hyping potential. Prove me wrong with results that match the marketing. #StableAudio #AIaudio\n\n---\n\nThis reply is critical of the model\u0027s practical effectiveness, the reliance on prompting, and the accessibility for non-enterprise users, while maintaining a tone that challenges Stability AI to back up their claims with tangible results. If you\u2019d like a different tone or focus for the criticism, let me know!",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a brutally honest and critical reply to Stability AI\u0027s X post, focusing on the gap between the promise and the reality, and the need for practical improvements:\n\n\u0022Honestly, \u0027enterprise-grade sound production\u0027 sounds great, but let\u0027s talk real-world results. The last version had a long way to go in terms of actual music creation. Improved musical structure is a MUST, not a bonus feature. Two-second inference on a GPU is meaningless if the output is still garbage. Audio inpainting sounds interesting, but does it actually work seamlessly?\n\nThe guide is appreciated, but prompt engineering shouldn\u0027t be the solution to fundamental model shortcomings. Focus on improving the core quality and coherence of the audio generation itself. Until Stable Audio consistently produces genuinely usable, high-quality audio without requiring arcane prompting rituals, it\u0027s just another incremental update in a crowded field. Prove the \u0027enterprise-grade\u0027 claim with audio that actually sounds professional *out of the box.*\u0022\n"
