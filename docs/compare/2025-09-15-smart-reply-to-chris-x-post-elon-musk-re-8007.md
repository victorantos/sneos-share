  prompt="smart reply to Chris X post: Elon Musk represents absolutely no one here in the Scotland, the UK nor indeed in the US.  He isn’t elected by anyone to do anything in the political spectrum&#10;&#10;Being the richest just proves it doesn’t make you either clever, brave or wise."
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "While Elon Musk may not hold an elected position, influence in today\u0027s world often extends beyond politics. Wealth and innovation can drive significant change, but they don\u2019t automatically equate to wisdom or leadership. Ultimately, true representation comes from accountability to the people, through democratic processes\u2014not just financial power.",
    "Claude": "Here are a few smart reply options:\n\n**Option 1 (Balanced):**\n\u0022Fair point about elected representation. Though wealth doesn\u0027t automatically equal wisdom, it\u0027s worth noting that in democratic societies, influence often extends beyond just elected officials - through business, media, activism, etc. The real question might be: how do we ensure all voices in the conversation are heard, not just the loudest ones?\u0022\n\n**Option 2 (Agreeable):**\n\u0022You\u0027ve hit on something important - there\u0027s a big difference between having a platform and having a mandate. Money can amplify a voice, but it doesn\u0027t necessarily make that voice more informed or representative of what people actually need.\u0022\n\n**Option 3 (Thought-provoking):**\n\u0022Interesting perspective. It raises the broader question of how much influence unelected figures should have in political discourse - whether that\u0027s business leaders, celebrities, or activists. Where do we draw those lines in a free society?\u0022\n\nChoose based on whether you want to agree, challenge thoughtfully, or find middle ground in the discussion.",
    "Gemini": "Here are a few smart reply options to the X post, ranging in tone:\n\n**Option 1 (Neutral/Inquisitive):**\n\n\u003E Interesting perspective. What specific actions or statements by Elon Musk are you referring to that suggest he\u0027s trying to represent Scotland, the UK, or the US politically?\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly Agreeing):**\n\n\u003E I see your point. Wealth doesn\u0027t automatically equate to political expertise or understanding of a population\u0027s needs.\n\n**Option 3 (Direct/Assertive):**\n\n\u003E Agreed. Economic power doesn\u0027t give someone a mandate to speak for entire populations. Political legitimacy comes from representation and democratic processes.\n\n**Option 4 (Humorous/Sarcastic):**\n\n\u003E So true! Being able to buy a social media platform doesn\u0027t suddenly make you an expert on Scottish (or any other) politics.\n"
