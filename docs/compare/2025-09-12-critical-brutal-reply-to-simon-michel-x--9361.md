  prompt="critical brutal reply to Simon Michel X post: Switzerland can become a global leader in hashtag#deeptech if we offer hashtag#startups and hashtag#scaleups the right conditions and access to capital. As CEO of Ypsomed AG and a member of the National Council, I can help overcome obstacles and create better conditions for innovation. Many thanks to Deep Tech Nation Switzerland for promoting this important work."
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "Simon, talk is cheap. Switzerland\u0027s \u0022right conditions\u0022 for #deeptech have existed for years, yet real breakthroughs remain limited. Access to capital isn\u0027t just about throwing money\u2014it requires visionary policies and dismantling bureaucratic red tape, something your dual roles haven\u0027t managed effectively. Promoting \u201Cinnovation\u201D sounds good, but results matter. Until we see tangible impact rather than empty pledges, your words ring hollow.",
    "Grok": "Hey Simon, while your enthusiasm for Switzerland\u2019s #deeptech potential is noted, let\u2019s cut through the fluff. As CEO of Ypsomed AG and a National Council member, you\u2019re in a position of power, yet the reality for #startups and #scaleups is far from ideal. Access to capital remains a pipe dream for many, bogged down by bureaucratic red tape and risk-averse investors. Your promise to \u201Covercome obstacles\u201D sounds nice, but where\u2019s the concrete action? Deep Tech Nation Switzerland\u2019s efforts are commendable, but relying on advocacy alone won\u2019t build a global leader. Show us tangible policy changes or funding initiatives, not just hashtags and platitudes. Switzerland\u2019s innovation ecosystem needs a brutal shake-up, not more polished PR. Prove you\u2019re serious, or step aside for someone who will be.",
    "Gemini": "To formulate a critical and brutal reply, I need to identify potential weaknesses or points of contention in Simon Michel\u0027s statement. Here are some possibilities:\n\n*   **Overly Optimistic View:** Is it realistic for Switzerland to become a global leader in deep tech, or is this an exaggeration? What are the specific challenges that might hinder this ambition?\n*   **Vague Promises:** What \u0022right conditions\u0022 and \u0022access to capital\u0022 are missing, and how exactly will Simon Michel help overcome obstacles? The statement lacks concrete details.\n*   **Conflict of Interest:** As CEO of Ypsomed, does Simon Michel have a vested interest in promoting deep tech, and could this influence his actions as a National Council member?\n*   **Lack of Urgency:** Is Switzerland already late to the deep tech game, and is this initiative too little, too late?\n\nBased on these points, I will generate search queries to gather information that could support a critical reply.\n\n"
