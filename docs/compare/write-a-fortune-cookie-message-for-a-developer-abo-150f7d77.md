    "ChatGPT": "\u0022Success is just a commit away. Deploy with confidence and watch your code shine!\u0022",
    "Claude": "\u0022Your code is strong, but your weekend is stronger. Deploy with wisdom, or debug with regret.\u0022",
    "Gemini": "**Option 1 (Humorous):**\n\n\u003E The release fairies are giggling. Double-check your backups. Good luck... you\u0027ll need it.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly Ominous):**\n\n\u003E The abyss stares back. But also, it might just be a database connection error.\n\n**Option 3 (Motivational with a Twist):**\n\n\u003E Today\u0027s code is tomorrow\u0027s stable release... probably. Have faith (and a rollback plan).\n\n**Option 4 (Practical):**\n\n\u003E Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors. Expect turbulence. Have your monitoring tools ready.\n\n**Option 5 (Short and Sweet):**\n\n\u003E Deploy with caution. Weekend with relaxation.\n\n**Option 6 (Data-Driven):**\n\n\u003E Your code coverage looks good... but is it *good enough*?\n\nChoose the one that best fits your (or the developer\u0027s) sense of humor and the perceived level of risk! Good luck with the deployment!\n"
