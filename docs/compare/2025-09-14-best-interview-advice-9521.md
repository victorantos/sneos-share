    "Claude": "Here\u0027s my best interview advice:\n\n## Before the Interview\n- **Research thoroughly**: Study the company, role, recent news, and key people\n- **Practice your stories**: Prepare 5-7 specific examples using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)\n- **Prepare thoughtful questions**: Shows genuine interest and helps you evaluate fit\n\n## During the Interview\n- **Listen actively**: Answer what they\u0027re actually asking, not what you think they want to hear\n- **Be specific**: Use concrete examples and numbers when possible\n- **Show enthusiasm**: Genuine interest is often the tiebreaker between qualified candidates\n- **Ask for clarification**: It\u0027s better to ask than guess what they mean\n\n## Key Mindset Shifts\n- **It\u0027s a conversation, not an interrogation**: You\u0027re evaluating them too\n- **Show growth mindset**: Talk about what you learned from challenges, not just successes\n- **Be authentic**: Don\u0027t try to be perfect\u2014be genuinely yourself\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Speaking negatively about past employers\n- Being too vague in answers\n- Not asking any questions\n- Forgetting to follow up afterward\n\n## The Secret Weapon\n**Connect your experience to their specific needs.** Don\u0027t just list what you\u0027ve done\u2014explain how it directly helps solve their problems.\n\nWhat type of interview are you preparing for? I can give more targeted advice.",
    "Gemini": "Okay, let\u0027s break down the best interview advice into actionable categories. I\u0027ll cover preparation, during the interview, and post-interview.\n\n**I. Pre-Interview: Laying the Foundation for Success**\n\n*   **Thorough Research is Your Superpower:**\n    *   **Company Deep Dive:** Don\u0027t just skim the \u0022About Us\u0022 page. Understand their mission, values, recent news, competitors, market position, and company culture.  Use LinkedIn, Glassdoor, their website (news, blog), and industry publications.  Ask yourself:\n        *   What are their biggest challenges and opportunities?\n        *   What are their values, and how do they demonstrate them?\n        *   How does this role contribute to the company\u0027s overall goals?\n    *   **Role Specifics:** Analyze the job description meticulously. Identify the key skills, responsibilities, and qualifications they\u0027re seeking.  Think about specific examples from your past that demonstrate you possess those qualities.\n    *   **Interviewer Research:** If you know who you\u0027re interviewing with, look them up on LinkedIn. Understand their role, experience, and potentially their interests. This can help you build rapport and tailor your answers.\n\n*   **Master the STAR Method (and Beyond):**\n    *   **STAR is Your Framework:** Situation, Task, Action, Result. This is the gold standard for behavioral questions (e.g., \u0022Tell me about a time you failed\u0022).\n        *   **Situation:** Briefly set the scene and provide context.\n        *   **Task:** Describe the specific task or challenge you faced.\n        *   **Action:** Detail *your* specific actions \u2013 what *you* did.  Use \u0022I\u0022 statements, not \u0022we.\u0022\n        *   **Result:** Quantify the results whenever possible. What was the positive outcome of your actions? What did you learn?\n    *   **Beyond STAR: STAR-L:** Some recommend adding \u0022Lessons Learned\u0022 to the end. This shows self-awareness and a growth mindset.\n    *   **Prepare a List of Stories:** Brainstorm a list of 5-7 strong stories that showcase a range of skills (leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, communication, initiative, etc.).  Practice telling these stories using the STAR method.  Adapt them to fit different questions.\n    *   **Quantify When Possible:** Numbers make your accomplishments more impactful.  Instead of \u0022Improved customer satisfaction,\u0022 say \u0022Improved customer satisfaction scores by 15%.\u0022\n\n*   **Anticipate Common Interview Questions (and Prepare Thoughtful Answers):**\n    *   **The Classics:**\n        *   \u0022Tell me about yourself.\u0022 (Focus on your career story and how it aligns with the role).\n        *   \u0022Why are you interested in this role/company?\u0022 (Show genuine enthusiasm and connect your skills and goals to their needs).\n        *   \u0022What are your strengths and weaknesses?\u0022 (Strengths: Relevant to the job. Weaknesses:  Genuine, but framed positively \u2013 something you\u0027re actively working to improve).\n        *   \u0022Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\u0022 (Align with the company\u0027s growth potential and show ambition, but be realistic).\n        *   \u0022Why should we hire you?\u0022 (A concise summary of your key qualifications and how you can add value).\n    *   **Behavioral Questions:** (Use STAR)\n        *   \u0022Tell me about a time you failed.\u0022\n        *   \u0022Tell me about a time you had to overcome a challenge.\u0022\n        *   \u0022Tell me about a time you worked on a team.\u0022\n        *   \u0022Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision.\u0022\n        *   \u0022Tell me about a time you showed leadership.\u0022\n    *   **Technical Questions:** (If applicable, practice coding, problem-solving, or answering industry-specific questions).\n    *   **Prepare Questions to Ask Them:** This is crucial!  It shows engagement and genuine interest.  Avoid asking questions that are easily found on their website.  Examples:\n        *   \u0022What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?\u0022\n        *   \u0022What opportunities are there for professional development within the company?\u0022\n        *   \u0022What does a typical day/week look like in this role?\u0022\n        *   \u0022What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for this role?\u0022\n        *   \u0022What is the company culture like?\u0022\n        *   \u0022What are the next steps in the interview process?\u0022\n\n*   **Practice, Practice, Practice!**\n    *   **Mock Interviews:**  The best way to prepare.  Ask a friend, family member, or career counselor to conduct mock interviews.  Record yourself and review the footage.\n    *   **Verbalize Your Thoughts:**  Practice answering questions out loud. This helps you refine your responses and identify areas where you need more clarity.\n    *   **Focus on Delivery:**  Pay attention to your tone of voice, body language, and pacing.  Speak clearly and confidently.\n\n*   **Prepare Logistics and Appearance:**\n    *   **Plan Your Outfit:** Choose professional attire that is appropriate for the company culture. Ensure it\u0027s clean, well-fitting, and comfortable.  (When in doubt, err on the side of slightly more formal).\n    *   **Test Your Tech (Virtual Interviews):**  Ensure your camera, microphone, and internet connection are working properly. Choose a quiet and well-lit location.  Close unnecessary programs on your computer.  Practice using the video conferencing platform.  Consider your background.\n    *   **Plan Your Route (In-Person Interviews):**  Know the location of the interview and plan your route in advance.  Factor in traffic and parking.  Arrive 10-15 minutes early.\n    *   **Prepare Documents:** Have copies of your resume, cover letter, portfolio (if applicable), and any other relevant documents.  Have them readily available both physically and digitally.\n\n*   **Mental Preparation:**\n    *   **Positive Mindset:** Believe in yourself and your abilities.  Visualize a successful interview.\n    *   **Manage Anxiety:**  Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation.\n    *   **Get Enough Sleep:**  A well-rested mind is a sharp mind.\n\n**II. During the Interview: Making a Strong Impression**\n\n*   **First Impressions Matter:**\n    *   **Be on Time (or Early):**  Punctuality shows respect for the interviewer\u0027s time.\n    *   **Professional Demeanor:**  Maintain eye contact, smile, and offer a firm handshake (if in person and appropriate).  Be polite and respectful to everyone you encounter.\n    *   **Body Language:**  Sit up straight, avoid fidgeting, and maintain open and engaged body language.\n\n*   **Active Listening is Key:**\n    *   **Pay Attention:**  Listen carefully to the questions being asked.  Don\u0027t interrupt.\n    *   **Clarify if Needed:**  If you\u0027re unsure about a question, ask for clarification.  It\u0027s better to ask than to answer incorrectly.\n    *   **Take a Moment to Think:**  It\u0027s okay to pause briefly before answering a question.  This shows that you\u0027re considering your response carefully.\n\n*   **Answer Questions Concisely and Effectively:**\n    *   **Stay on Topic:**  Avoid rambling or going off on tangents.\n    *   **Provide Specific Examples:**  Use the STAR method to illustrate your points.\n    *   **Quantify Your Accomplishments:**  Use numbers to demonstrate the impact of your work.\n    *   **Be Honest and Authentic:**  Don\u0027t exaggerate your skills or experience.\n\n*   **Show Enthusiasm and Passion:**\n    *   **Express Your Interest:**  Clearly articulate why you\u0027re interested in the role and the company.\n    *   **Let Your Personality Shine:**  Be yourself and let your enthusiasm come through.\n    *   **Connect with the Interviewer:**  Try to build rapport and find common ground.\n\n*   **Handle Difficult Questions Gracefully:**\n    *   **Stay Calm:**  Don\u0027t get defensive or flustered.\n    *   **Acknowledge the Question:**  Show that you understand the interviewer\u0027s concern.\n    *   **Provide a Thoughtful Response:**  Even if you don\u0027t have a perfect answer, demonstrate your problem-solving skills and willingness to learn.\n    *   **Example for \u0022Weakness\u0022 Question:** \u0022While I\u0027m highly proficient in X, I\u0027m still developing my skills in Y.  I\u0027ve been taking online courses/attending workshops/seeking mentorship to improve in this area, and I\u0027ve already seen progress in [specific example].\u0022\n\n*   **Ask Thoughtful Questions (End of Interview):**\n    *   **Prepare in Advance:**  Have a list of questions ready to go.\n    *   **Tailor Your Questions:**  Adapt your questions based on the conversation you\u0027ve had with the interviewer.\n    *   **Show Genuine Interest:**  Ask questions that demonstrate your curiosity and desire to learn more.\n\n*   **Closing Strong:**\n    *   **Reiterate Your Interest:**  Thank the interviewer for their time and reiterate your strong interest in the role.\n    *   **Summarize Your Key Qualifications:**  Briefly highlight your key skills and how they align with the company\u0027s needs.\n    *   **Ask About Next Steps:**  Inquire about the timeline for the hiring process.\n    *   **Thank You:** Thank them again and express your appreciation for their time.\n\n**III. Post-Interview: Following Up and Reflecting**\n\n*   **Send a Thank-You Note (Within 24 Hours):**\n    *   **Personalized:**  Address each interviewer individually.\n    *   **Specific:**  Mention something specific that you discussed during the interview.\n    *   **Reinforce Your Interest:**  Reiterate your enthusiasm for the role and the company.\n    *   **Proofread Carefully:**  Ensure there are no typos or grammatical errors.  Email is usually preferred, but a handwritten note can be a nice touch in some situations.\n    *   **Example:**  \u0022Dear [Interviewer Name], Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me yesterday about the [Role Name] position at [Company Name].
