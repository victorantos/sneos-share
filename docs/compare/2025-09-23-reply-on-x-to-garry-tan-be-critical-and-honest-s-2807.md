  prompt="reply on X to Garry Tan, be critical and honest: San Francisco is healing. The boom loop is starting. We need supervisors elected in 2026 that support housing, strong public schools and building housing. &#10;&#10;Manny Yekutiel is that person for District 8. Consider max donating $500 here."
  :responses='{
    "ChatGPT": "San Francisco\u2019s challenges run deeper than hopeful slogans. While the \u201Cboom loop\u201D talk sounds optimistic, without addressing systemic issues like homelessness, income inequality, and infrastructure decay, progress will be fragile. Electing supervisors who truly prioritize practical solutions for housing and schools is essential. I\u2019ll look into Manny Yekutiel\u2019s platform, but donations should only follow clear, actionable commitments and proven results.",
    "Grok": "Hey Garry, while I\u2019m glad to see optimism about SF\u2019s recovery, I\u2019m skeptical about pinning so much hope on one candidate. Manny Yekutiel may have good intentions, but we need more than promises\u2014where\u2019s the concrete plan for housing and schools? District 8 deserves proven results, not just enthusiasm. Let\u2019s push for transparency on policies before maxing out donations. #SFDistrict8 #SanFrancisco",
    "Gemini": "Okay, here\u0027s a draft of an X reply to Garry Tan, critical and honest, based on your input:\n\n\u0022Garry, while I appreciate the optimism, let\u0027s be real. San Francisco\u0027s \u0027healing\u0027 is fragile. The \u0027boom loop\u0027 you\u0027re talking about depends entirely on getting serious about fundamental changes. That means electing supervisors in 2026 who *actually* prioritize housing, fund public schools properly, and remove the roadblocks to building. Manny Yekutiel in D8 seems to get it. Putting our money where our mouth is with a max donation of $500 is a start.\u0022\n"
