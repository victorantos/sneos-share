    "Claude": "Here\u0027s a framework to help you navigate this important decision:\n\n## Start with Self-Assessment\n\n**Identify your passions:**\n- What subjects energize you?\n- What activities make you lose track of time?\n- What problems do you want to solve?\n\n**Evaluate your skills:**\n- What are you naturally good at?\n- What do others often ask for your help with?\n- What skills could you develop further?\n\n## Research Career Realities\n\n**For passion-focused fields:**\n- What\u0027s the actual job market like?\n- Are there alternative career paths within the field?\n- What\u0027s the typical salary progression?\n- Can you live comfortably on expected earnings?\n\n**For high-demand fields:**\n- Could you find aspects you genuinely enjoy?\n- What\u0027s the work-life balance typically like?\n- Is there room for creativity or personal projects?\n\n## Consider Hybrid Approaches\n\n- **Double major or minor** in both areas\n- **Choose a broader major** that opens multiple doors\n- **Plan for passion as a side pursuit** initially\n- **Look for fields that blend both** (e.g., UX design for tech \u002B creativity)\n\n## Test Before Committing\n\n- Internships or job shadowing\n- Informational interviews with professionals\n- Part-time work or volunteer opportunities\n- Online courses in areas of interest\n\nRemember: Your major doesn\u0027t lock you into one path forever. Many successful people pivot careers, and transferable skills matter more than you might think.\n\nWhat specific fields are you considering? I can help you explore the balance for your particular situation.",
    "Mistral": "Choosing a college major that balances your passion with career prospects is a crucial decision. Here are some steps to help you make an informed choice:\n\n### 1. **Self-Assessment**\n   - **Interests:** Identify what you are passionate about. What activities or subjects do you enjoy the most?\n   - **Skills:** Consider your strengths and weaknesses. What are you naturally good at?\n   - **Values:** Think about what is important to you in a career. Is it job satisfaction, work-life balance, or financial stability?\n\n### 2. **Research Career Prospects**\n   - **Job Market:** Look into the demand for jobs in the fields you are interested in. Are there plenty of opportunities, or is the market saturated?\n   - **Growth Potential:** Consider the future growth of the industry. Is it expected to expand or decline?\n   - **Salary:** Research the average salaries for different careers. While money shouldn\u0027t be the only factor, it\u0027s important to know what you can expect.\n\n### 3. **Explore Majors**\n   - **Coursework:** Look at the curriculum for different majors. Does the coursework align with your interests and skills?\n   - **Flexibility:** Consider majors that offer flexibility. Some majors can lead to a variety of careers, while others are more specialized.\n   - **Internships and Experience:** Look for majors that offer internships, co-op programs, or other hands-on experiences. These can be invaluable for gaining practical skills and making industry connections.\n\n### 4. **Seek Advice**\n   - **Career Counselors:** Meet with a career counselor at your college. They can provide insights and resources to help you make a decision.\n   - **Professionals:** Talk to professionals in the fields you are considering. They can offer firsthand knowledge about the industry and what it takes to succeed.\n   - **Alumni:** Reach out to alumni from your college who have majored in the fields you are interested in. They can provide valuable insights into their experiences and career paths.\n\n### 5. **Consider Long-Term Goals**\n   - **Career Path:** Think about where you want to be in 5, 10, or 20 years. Does the major you are considering align with your long-term career goals?\n   - **Further Education:** Consider whether you plan to pursue further education, such as a master\u0027s degree or professional certification. Some careers require advanced degrees.\n\n### 6. **Balance Passion and Practicality**\n   - **Passion:** Choose a major that you are genuinely interested in. Passion can drive you to excel and find fulfillment in your work.\n   - **Practicality:** Ensure that the major you choose has viable career prospects. This doesn\u0027t mean you have to choose the most lucrative field, but it\u0027s important to have a realistic understanding of your job options.\n\n### 7. **Test the Waters**\n   - **Electives:** Take elective courses in different fields to get a taste of what they are like. This can help you narrow down your choices.\n   - **Extracurricular Activities:** Join clubs, organizations, or volunteer opportunities related to your interests. This can provide practical experience and help you determine if a field is right for you.\n\n### 8. **Stay Flexible**\n   - **Change of Heart:** Remember that it\u0027s okay to change your major if you find that your initial choice isn\u0027t the right fit. Many students change their majors during their college careers.\n   - **Dual Majors or Minors:** Consider pursuing a dual major or a minor in a complementary field. This can broaden your skill set and make you more versatile in the job market.\n\n### Example Scenarios\n\n#### Scenario 1: Passion for Art, Interest in Business\n   - **Major:** Consider a major in Art with a minor in Business, or vice versa. This combination can prepare you for careers in art management, marketing, or entrepreneurship.\n   - **Career Path:** You could work in an art gallery, start your own art business, or work in the marketing department of an arts organization.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Love for Writing, Concerns About Job Prospects\n   - **Major:** Consider a major in English or Journalism, but also take courses in Digital Media or Communications.\n   - **Career Path:** You could pursue a career in content creation, digital marketing, or public relations, where writing skills are highly valued.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Interest in Science, Unsure About Specific Field\n   - **Major:** Consider a broad major like Biology or Chemistry, which can lead to various careers in research, healthcare, or education.\n   - **Career Path:** You could go on to medical school, work in a research lab, or teach science at the high school or college level.\n\nBy carefully considering your passions, skills, and career prospects, you can choose a college major that sets you up for both personal fulfillment and professional success.",
    "Grok": "Choosing a college major is an important decision that involves balancing your personal passions with practical career prospects. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you make an informed choice:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify Your Passions and Interests\n- **Reflect on what excites you**: What subjects or activities do you enjoy most? What could you spend hours doing without feeling bored?\n- **Consider your values**: Do you want to help others, create things, solve problems, or explore new ideas?\n- **Think long-term**: Ask yourself if your interest is a hobby or something you\u2019d like to build a career around.\n\n**Example**: If you love storytelling and writing, majors like Creative Writing, Journalism, or Communications might appeal to you. If you\u2019re passionate about technology, Computer Science or Engineering could be a fit.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Career Prospects\n- **Job demand and growth**: Look for majors tied to industries with strong job growth. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or websites like Glassdoor can provide data on job outlooks, salaries, and required skills.\n- **Salary potential**: While money isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019s important to understand the earning potential of careers related to your major.\n- **Versatility**: Some majors (e.g., Business, Computer Science, or Psychology) offer flexibility to pivot into various roles, while others (e.g., Fine Arts or Anthropology) may have narrower paths.\n\n**Example Resources**: Check out platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, or O*NET to explore job titles, industries, and required education for fields you\u2019re interested in.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Balance Passion and Practicality\n- **Find overlap**: Look for majors that align with both your interests and strong career prospects. For instance:\n  - Passion for helping people \u002B good job outlook = Nursing, Social Work, or Education.\n  - Love for creativity \u002B growing industry = Graphic Design, Digital Marketing, or UI/UX Design.\n- **Consider double majors or minors**: If your passion doesn\u2019t have the best job prospects, pair it with a more practical major or minor. For example, major in Art History but minor in Business to gain marketable skills.\n- **Think about transferable skills**: Some majors teach skills (critical thinking, communication, data analysis) that apply to many fields, even if the major itself isn\u2019t directly vocational.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Explore Specific Majors\nHere are some popular majors that often balance passion and practicality, categorized by interest area:\n\n- **STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)**:\n  - **Computer Science**: High demand for software developers, data analysts, and cybersecurity experts. Combines problem-solving and creativity.\n  - **Engineering**: Fields like civil, mechanical, or biomedical engineering offer solid salaries and the chance to build impactful solutions.\n  - **Data Science**: If you enjoy math and technology, this growing field offers roles in AI, machine learning, and analytics.\n  - **Career Prospects**: High demand, salaries often starting at $60,000\u2013$100,000\u002B, strong job growth (per BLS, tech roles grow 15\u201322% by 2032).\n\n- **Business and Economics**:\n  - **Business Administration**: Versatile degree covering management, marketing, and finance. Great for entrepreneurial spirits.\n  - **Economics**: Combines analytical skills with real-world applications in policy, finance, or consulting.\n  - **Career Prospects**: Broad opportunities in corporate roles, starting salaries around $50,000\u2013$70,000, with growth potential in leadership positions.\n\n- **Healthcare**:\n  - **Nursing**: Combines a passion for helping others with excellent job security and competitive pay.\n  - **Public Health**: Focuses on community well-being and offers roles in policy, research, or nonprofits.\n  - **Career Prospects**: High demand (nursing projected to grow 6% by 2032 per BLS), salaries starting at $50,000\u2013$80,000.\n\n- **Creative Fields with Practical Applications**:\n  - **Graphic Design or Digital Media**: Merges creativity with demand in advertising, tech, and entertainment.\n  - **Communications**: Covers PR, marketing, and media\u2014great for storytellers with people skills.\n  - **Career Prospects**: Moderate to strong growth in digital fields (5\u201310% per BLS), starting salaries $40,000\u2013$60,000.\n\n- **Social Sciences and Education**:\n  - **Psychology**: Offers paths in counseling, HR, or research with further education.\n  - **Education**: Ideal for those passionate about teaching and making a difference.\n  - **Career Prospects**: Varied\u2014teaching and counseling have steady demand, starting salaries $35,000\u2013$50,000, often requiring graduate degrees for higher pay.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Test the Waters\n- **Take introductory courses**: Many colleges let you explore different subjects before declaring a major. Use these to confirm your interest.\n- **Internships and shadowing**: Gain real-world exposure to fields you\u2019re considering. For example, shadow a nurse or intern at a tech startup.\n- **Talk to professionals**: Reach out to alumni, professors, or people in industries you\u2019re curious about via LinkedIn or career fairs.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Consider Your Long-Term Goals\n- **Graduate school**: If you\u2019re considering further education (e.g., law, medicine, or a master\u2019s), choose an undergrad major that prepares you (e.g., Biology for med school, Political Science for law).\n- **Lifestyle**: Some careers tied to certain majors (e.g., Medicine or Finance) may demand long hours or high stress. Ensure the lifestyle fits your personality.\n- **Adaptability**: Pick a field that can evolve with industry trends. For instance, tech and healthcare are more future-proof than some traditional industries.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Avoid Common Pitfalls\n- **Choosing based on others\u2019 opinions**: Don\u2019t pick a major just because your parents or peers think it\u2019s \u201Csafe.\u201D You\u2019ll be the one studying and working in that field.\n- **Ignoring job prospects entirely**: Passion is crucial, but you\u2019ll need a plan to support yourself after graduation.\n- **Fearing change**: It\u2019s okay to switch majors if your interests or goals evolve. Many students do this in their first or second year.\n\n---\n\n### Example Decision-Making Scenario\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re torn between **Art** (your passion) and **Business** (practical choice).\n- **Option 1**: Major in Business with a minor in Art. You gain marketable skills while still pursuing creativity through coursework or clubs.\n- **Option 2**: Major in Art but focus on applied fields like Graphic Design or Animation, which have better job prospects than fine arts.\n- **Outcome**: Either way, you\u2019re blending passion with a path to employment. Research shows Business majors have a 3.8% unemployment rate, while Art-related fields can be higher (5\u20137%), so pairing skills strategically helps (data from National Center for Education Statistics).\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation\nIf you\u2019re unsure where to start, consider **Computer Science**, **Business Administration**, or **Nursing** as majors with strong career prospects across diverse interests (tech, leadership, or helping others). These fields often provide flexibility, high demand, and decent starting salaries while allowing room to explore personal passions through electives, minors, or side projects.\n\nTake time to reflect, research, and experiment. Speak with academic advisors at your college\u2014they can provide tailored advice based on your skills and goals. Remember, your major doesn\u2019t lock you into a single career path; it\u2019s a foundation you can build upon with experience and adaptability. What are some interests or fields you\u2019re leaning toward? I\u2019d be happy to dive deeper!"
