    "ChatGPT": "Sure, here\u2019s a brutal critical reply you can use:\n\n\u002210xing the number of YC crypto companies? Maybe instead focus on 10xing the quality instead of flooding the market with barely-thought-out projects that do nothing but hype the bubble. Quantity over quality is exactly how we ended up with this mess in the first place.\u0022",
    "Grok": "Here\u0027s a brutal, critical reply to Brian Armstrong\u0027s X post suggesting it\u0027s time to \u002210x the number of YC crypto companies\u0022:\n\n---\n\nHey Brian, pumping more crypto startups through YC sounds like a great way to inflate another bubble. Haven\u2019t we learned from the countless failed projects and scams that flooded the space last cycle? The industry needs quality over quantity\u2014focusing on real utility, not just speculative hype. 10x-ing the number of startups without addressing regulatory clarity or consumer protection is just asking for more chaos and investor losses. How about fixing the broken trust in crypto first before mass-producing more half-baked ideas?\n\n---\n\nThis response challenges the idea of aggressively scaling the number of crypto startups by highlighting past failures, the risk of another speculative bubble, and the need for trust and regulation in the industry. It\u2019s direct and critical while staying focused on the core issue raised in the post.",
    "Gemini": "Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have enough information to determine the exact content of Brian Armstrong\u0027s X post or the specific critical reply it received. However, I can share some general information regarding Brian Armstrong and his involvement with Y Combinator (YC) and the crypto space:\n\n*   **Brian Armstrong \u0026 Y Combinator:** Armstrong, the Co-Founder and CEO of Coinbase, has close ties to Y Combinator. He participated in YC to help launch Coinbase. He has also spoken about the advice he received at YC and how it helped him find product/market fit for Coinbase.\n*   **Armstrong\u0027s Vision:** Armstrong has been described as having a vision of a world where it is easier to send and receive money without paying outrageous fees.\n*   **Armstrong\u0027s views on crypto:** Armstrong anticipates a constructive stance on crypto in the US post-election.\n"
