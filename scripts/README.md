# Autogenerated Posts Configuration

## Post Template for Autogenerated Content

All posts generated programmatically and placed in `docs/compare/autogenerated/` **must** include the following frontmatter to use the custom AutogeneratedIndex layout:

### Required Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: "Model1 vs Model2 vs Model3: Topic Name"
description: "AI model comparison: Brief description..."
date: YYYY-MM-DD
category: comparison
layout: AutogeneratedIndex    # ← THIS IS REQUIRED!
tags:
  - Model1
  - Model2
  - Model3
  - AI Comparison
author: SNEOS Community
head:
  - - meta
    - name: description
      content: "AI model comparison: Brief description..."
---
```

### Key Configuration

The **critical field** for autogenerated posts is:
```yaml
layout: AutogeneratedIndex
```

This applies the custom layout with:
- ✅ Expandable category sidebar with dynamic post organization
- ✅ 3-column support for AI model comparisons on wide screens (1400px+)
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Statistics and navigation

### Where to Configure

Update your post generation system (API/script/service that creates these markdown files) to always include `layout: AutogeneratedIndex` in the frontmatter.

**Important:** Posts in `docs/compare/autogenerated/` should automatically get this layout in their generation template. If you're manually creating posts, ensure this field is included.
